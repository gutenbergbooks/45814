<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This grammar is intended for students who have already
received instruction in the rudiments. Still, every such textbook
must begin at the beginning. Part One, therefore, which
occupies <a href="#page-1">pp.&nbsp;1–24</a>, gives a succinct treatment of the Parts of
Speech in the Sentence and of their substitutes, the Phrase
and the Clause, concluding with a Summary of Definitions.
Thus it clears the way for what follows, and may be utilized
as a review, if the student needs to refresh his memory.</p>

<p>Part Two deals specifically and fully with Inflections and
Syntax (<a href="#page-25">pp.&nbsp;25–182</a>). It includes also a chapter on the use of
subordinate clauses as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs (<a href="#page-157">pp.&nbsp;157–162</a>),
as well as a chapter in which such clauses are logically
classified in accordance with their particular offices in the
expression of thought (<a href="#page-163">pp.&nbsp;163–182</a>).</p>

<p>Part Three (<a href="#page-183">pp.&nbsp;183–226</a>) develops the subject of Analysis
in its natural order, first explaining how sentences are put
together, and then illustrating the process by which they may
be resolved into their constituent parts. Modifiers and Complements
are classified, and the so-called Independent Elements
are discussed. There is added a special chapter on Combinations
of Clauses, in which the grammatical and logical relations
of coördination and subordination are set forth, and their functions
in the effective use of language are considered. This
portion of the book, it is hoped, will be especially useful to
students of English composition.</p>

<p>The Appendix furnishes lists of verbs, tables of conjugation,
rules for capitals and marks of punctuation, a summary
of important rules of syntax, and a brief history of the English
language.</p>

<p><a id="page-iv" href="#page-iv" class="pagenum" title="iv"></a>
The Exercises (<a href="#page-227">pp.&nbsp;227–290</a>) are collected at the end of the
text, so as not to break continuity. References prefixed to
each, as well as page-numbers in the Table of Contents, enable
the teacher to attach them, at will, to the topics which they
concern. The passages for parsing, analysis, etc., have been
carefully selected from a wide range of eminent British and
American writers. The name of the author is often appended
to the quotation, when the passage is particularly noteworthy
either for its contents or its form. In most cases, however, this
has not been done; but the student may always feel confident
that he is occupying himself with specimens of English as actually
composed by distinguished authors. The constructive
exercises call particular attention to those matters in which
error is especially prevalent.</p>

<p>An advanced grammar must aim to be serviceable in two
ways. It should afford the means for continuous and systematic
study of the subject or of any part of it; and it should also
be useful for reference in connection with the study of composition
and of literature. With this latter end in view, many
notes and observations have been included, in smaller type,
to show the nature and development of the various forms and
constructions, and to point out differences between the usage of
to-day and that which the student observes in Shakspere and
other English classics. The fulness of the index makes it easy
to find anything that the volume contains.</p>

<p>In accordance with the desire of many teachers, certain
topics of importance have been treated with unusual thoroughness.
Among these may be mentioned the uses of <i>shall</i> and
<i>will</i>, <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>, the infinitive and the infinitive clause,
conditional sentences, indirect discourse, and the combination
of clauses in sentences of different kinds.</p>

<p>The authors are indebted to several teachers for suggestions
and criticism. Particular acknowledgment is due to Mr. Theodore
C. Mitchill, of the Jamaica High School, New York, and
Mr. C.&nbsp;L. Hooper, of the Chicago Normal School.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR</h3>

<h4>I. The Nature of Language</h4>

<p>Language is the expression of thought by means of spoken
or written words.</p>

<p>The English word <i>language</i> comes (through the French
<i>langue</i>) from the Latin <i>lingua</i>, “the tongue.” But the tongue
is not the only organ used in speaking. The lips, the teeth,
the roof of the mouth, the soft palate (or uvula), the nose, and
the vocal chords all help to produce the sounds of which language
consists. These various organs make up one delicate and
complicated piece of mechanism upon which the breath of the
speaker acts like that of a musician upon a clarinet or other
wind instrument.</p>

<p>Spoken language, then, is composed of a great variety of
sounds made with the vocal organs. A word may consist of
one sound (as <i>Ah!</i> or <i>O</i> or <i>I</i>), but most words consist of two
or more different sounds (as <i>go</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>try</i>, <i>finish</i>). Long or short,
however, a word is merely a sign made to express thought.</p>

<p>Thought may be imperfectly expressed by signs made with
the head, the hands, etc. Thus, if I grasp a person’s arm and
point to a dog, he may understand me to ask, “Do you see that
dog?” And his nod in reply may stand for “Yes, I see him.”
But any dialogue carried on in this way must be both fragmentary
and uncertain. To express our thoughts fully, freely, and
accurately, we must use words,—that is, signs made with the
voice. Such voice-signs have had meanings associated with
them by custom or tradition, so that their sense is at once
<a id="page-xii" href="#page-xii" class="pagenum" title="xii"></a>
understood by all. Their advantage is twofold: they are far
more numerous and varied than other signs; and the meanings
attached to them are much more definite than those of nods
and gestures.</p>

<p>Written words are signs made with the pen to represent and
recall to the mind the spoken words (or voice-signs). Written
language (that is, composition) must, of necessity, be somewhat
fuller than spoken language, as well as more formal and exact.
For the reader’s understanding is not assisted by the tones of
the voice, the changing expressions of the face, and the lively
gestures, which help to make spoken language intelligible.</p>

<p>Most words are the signs of definite ideas. Thus, <i>Charles</i>,
<i>captain</i>, <i>cat</i>, <i>mouse</i>, <i>bread</i>, <i>stone</i>, <i>cup</i>, <i>ink</i>, call up images or
pictures of persons or things; <i>strike</i>, <i>dive</i>, <i>climb</i>, <i>dismount</i>,
express particular kinds of action; <i>green</i>, <i>blue</i>, <i>careless</i>, <i>rocky</i>,
<i>triangular</i>, <i>muscular</i>, enable us to describe objects with accuracy.
Even general terms like <i>goodness</i>, <i>truth</i>, <i>courage</i>, <i>cowardice</i>,
<i>generosity</i>, have sufficiently precise meanings, for they name
qualities, or traits of character, with which everybody is familiar.</p>

<p>By the use of such words, even when not combined in groups,
we can express our thoughts much more satisfactorily than by
mere gestures. The utterance of the single word “Charles!”
may signify: “Hullo, Charles! are you here? I am surprised
to see you.” “Bread!” may suggest to the hearer: “Give me
bread! I am very hungry.” “Courage!” may be almost equivalent
to, “Don’t be down-hearted! Your troubles will soon
be over.”</p>

<p>Language, however, is not confined to the utterance of single
words. To express our thoughts we must put words together,—we
must combine them into groups; and such groups
have settled meanings (just as words have), established (like
the meanings of single words) by the customs or habits of the
particular language that we are speaking or writing. Further,
these groups are not thrown together haphazard. We must construct
them in accordance with certain fixed rules. Otherwise
<a id="page-xiii" href="#page-xiii" class="pagenum" title="xiii"></a>
we shall fail to express ourselves clearly and acceptably, and
we may even succeed in saying the opposite of what we mean.</p>

<p>In constructing these groups (which we call <b>phrases</b>, <b>clauses</b>,
and <b>sentences</b>) we have the aid of a large number of short words
like <i>and</i>, <i>if</i>, <i>by</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>was</i>, which are very different from
the definite and picturesque words that we have just examined.
They do not call up distinct images in the mind, and we should
find it hard to define any of them. Yet their importance in
the expression of thought is clear; for they serve to join other
words together, and to show their relation to each other in
those groups which make up connected speech.</p>

<p>Thus, “box heavy” conveys some meaning; but “<i>The</i> box
<i>is</i> heavy” is a clear and definite statement. <i>The</i> shows that
some particular box is meant, and <i>is</i> enables us to make an
assertion about it. <i>And</i>, in “Charles and John are my brothers,”
indicates that Charles and John are closely connected in my
thought, and that what I say of one applies also to the other.
<i>If</i>, in “If Charles comes, I shall be glad to see him,” connects
two statements, and shows that one of them is a mere supposition
(for Charles may or may not come).</p>

<p>In grouping words, our language has three different ways
of indicating their relations: (1) the forms of the words themselves;
(2) their order; (3) the use of little words like <i>and</i>, <i>if</i>,
<i>is</i>, etc.</p>

<p>I. <b>Change of form.</b> Words may change their form. Thus
the word <i>boy</i> becomes <i>boys</i> when more than one is meant; <i>kill</i>
becomes <i>killed</i> when past time is referred to; <i>was</i> becomes
<i>were</i> when we are speaking of two or more persons or things;
<i>fast</i> becomes <i>faster</i> when a higher degree of speed is indicated.
Such change of form is called <b>inflection</b>, and the word is said
to be <b>inflected</b>.</p>

<p>Inflection is an important means of showing the relations of
words in connected speech. In “Henry’s racket weighs fourteen
ounces,” the form <i>Henry’s</i> shows at once the relation
between Henry and the racket,—namely, that Henry owns or
<a id="page-xiv" href="#page-xiv" class="pagenum" title="xiv"></a>
possesses it. The word <i>Henry</i>, then, may change its form to
<i>Henry’s</i> to indicate ownership or possession.</p>

<p>II. <b>Order of words.</b> In “John struck Charles,” the way in
which the words are arranged shows who it was that struck,
and who received the blow. Change the order of words to
“Charles struck John,” and the meaning is reversed. It is,
then, the <b>order</b> that shows the relation of <i>John</i> to <i>struck</i>, and
of <i>struck</i> to <i>Charles</i>.</p>

<p>III. <b>Use of other words.</b> Compare the two sentences:</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The train <i>from</i> Boston has just arrived.</li>
  <li>The train <i>for</i> Boston has just arrived.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here <i>from</i> and <i>for</i> show the relation between the <i>train</i> and
<i>Boston</i>. “The Boston train” might mean either the train <i>from</i>
Boston or the train <i>for</i> Boston. By using <i>from</i> or <i>for</i> we make
the sense unmistakable.</p>

<p>Two matters, then, are of vital importance in language,—the
forms of words, and the relations of words. The science
which treats of these two matters is called <b>grammar</b>.</p>

<p><b>Inflection is a change in the form of a word indicating some change
in its meaning.</b></p>

<p><b>The relation in which a word stands to other words in the sentence
is called its construction.</b></p>

<p><b>Grammar is the science which treats of the forms and the constructions
of words.</b></p>

<p><b>Syntax is that department of grammar which treats of the constructions
of words.</b></p>

<p>Grammar, then, may be said to concern itself with two main
subjects,—inflection and syntax.</p>

<p>English belongs to a family of languages—the Indo-European
Family<a href="#footnote-1" id="marker-1" class="marker" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a>—which is rich in forms of inflection. This richness
may be seen in other members of the family,—such as Greek
or Latin. The Latin word <i>homo</i>, “man,” for example, has
<a id="page-xv" href="#page-xv" class="pagenum" title="xv"></a>
eight different inflectional forms,—<i>homo</i>, “a man”; <i>hominis</i>,
“of a man”; <i>homini</i>, “to a man,” and so on. Thus, in Latin,
the grammatical construction of a word is, in general, shown
by that particular inflectional ending (or termination) which
it has in any particular sentence. In the Anglo-Saxon period,<a href="#footnote-2" id="marker-2" class="marker" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a>
English was likewise well furnished with such inflectional
endings, though not so abundantly as Latin. Many of these,
however, had disappeared by Chaucer’s time (1340–1400), and
still others have since been lost, so that modern English is one
of the least inflected of languages. Such losses are not to be
lamented. By due attention to the order of words, and by
using <i>of</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>in</i>, and the like, we can express all the
relations denoted by the ancient inflections. The gain in simplicity
is enormous.</p>

<h4>II. Grammar and Usage</h4>

<p>Since language is the expression of thought, the rules of
grammar agree, in the main, with the laws of thought. In
other words, grammar is usually logical,—that is, its rules
accord, in general, with the principles of logic, which is the
science of exact reasoning.</p>

<p>The rules of grammar, however, do not derive their authority
from logic, but from good usage,—that is, from the customs
or habits followed by educated speakers and writers. These
customs, of course, differ among different nations, and every
language has therefore its own stock of peculiar constructions
or turns of expression. Such peculiarities are called <b>idioms</b>.</p>

<p>Thus, in English we say, “It is I”; but in French the idiom
is “C’est moi,” which corresponds to “It is me.” Many careless
speakers of English follow the French idiom in this particular,
but their practice has not yet come to be the accepted
usage. Hence, though “C’est moi” is correct in French, we
must still regard “It is me” as ungrammatical in English. It
<a id="page-xvi" href="#page-xvi" class="pagenum" title="xvi"></a>
would, however, become correct if it should ever be adopted
by the great majority of educated persons.</p>

<p>Grammar does not enact laws for the conduct of speech. Its
business is to ascertain and set forth those customs of language
which have the sanction of good usage. If good usage changes,
the rules of grammar must change. If two forms or constructions
are in good use, the grammarian must admit them both.
Occasionally, also, there is room for difference of opinion.
These facts, however, do not lessen the authority of grammar
in the case of any cultivated language. For in such a language
usage is so well settled in almost every particular as to enable
the grammarian to say positively what is right and what is
wrong. Even in matters of divided usage, it is seldom difficult
to determine which of two forms or constructions is preferred
by careful writers.</p>

<p>Every language has two standards of usage,—the colloquial
and the literary. By “colloquial language,” we mean the language
of conversation; by “literary language,” that employed
in literary composition. Everyday colloquial English admits
many words, forms, phrases, and constructions that would be
out of place in a dignified essay. On the other hand, it is an
error in taste to be always “talking like a book.” Unpractised
speakers and writers should, however, be conservative. They
should avoid, even in informal talk, any word or expression
that is of doubtful propriety. Only those who know what they
are about, can venture to take liberties. It is quite possible to
be correct without being stilted or affected.<a href="#footnote-3" id="marker-3" class="marker" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Every living language is constantly changing. Words, forms,
and constructions become <b>obsolete</b> (that is, go out of use) and
others take their places. Consequently, one often notes in the
older English classics, methods of expression which, though
formerly correct, are ungrammatical now. Here a twofold
<a id="page-xvii" href="#page-xvii" class="pagenum" title="xvii"></a>
caution is necessary. On the one hand, we must not criticise
Shakspere or Chaucer for using the English of his own time;
but, on the other hand, we must not try to defend our own
errors by appealing to ancient usage.</p>

<p class="example">Examples of constructions once in good use, but no longer admissible,
are: “the best of the two” (for “the better of the two”); “the most
unkindest cut of all”; “There’s two or three of us” (for <i>there are</i>); “I
have forgot the map” (for <i>forgotten</i>); “Every one of these letters are in
my name” (for <i>is</i>); “I think it be” (for <i>is</i>).</p>

<p>The language of poetry admits many old words, forms, and
constructions that are no longer used in ordinary prose. These
are called <b>archaisms</b> (that is, ancient expressions). Among the
commonest archaisms are <i>thou</i>, <i>ye</i>, <i>hath</i>, <i>thinkest</i>, <i>doth</i>. Such
forms are also common in prose, in what is known as the
<b>solemn style</b>, which is modelled, in great part, on the language
of the Bible.<a href="#footnote-4" id="marker-4" class="marker" title="Footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In general, it should be remembered that the style which
one uses should be appropriate,—that is, it should fit the occasion.
A short story and a scientific exposition will differ in
style; a familiar letter will naturally shun the formalities of
business or legal correspondence. Good style is not a necessary
result of grammatical correctness, but without such correctness
it is, of course, impossible.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p>1. Language is the expression of thought by means of spoken or
written words.</p>

<p>2. Words are the signs of ideas.</p>

<p>Spoken words are signs made with the vocal organs; written
words are signs made with the pen to represent the spoken words.</p>

<p><a id="page-xviii" href="#page-xviii" class="pagenum" title="xviii"></a>
The meanings of these signs are settled by custom or tradition in
each language.</p>

<p>3. Most words are the signs of definite ideas: as,—<i>Charles</i>, <i>captain</i>,
<i>cat</i>, <i>strike</i>, <i>dive</i>, <i>climb</i>, <i>triangular</i>, <i>careless</i>.</p>

<p>Other words, of less definite meaning, serve to connect the more
definite words and to show their relations to each other in connected
speech.</p>

<p>4. In the expression of thought, words are combined into groups
called phrases, clauses, and sentences.</p>

<p>5. The relation in which a word stands to other words in the
sentence is called its construction.</p>

<p>The construction of English words is shown in three ways: (1) by
their form; (2) by their order; (3) by the use of other words like
<i>to</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>is</i>, etc.</p>

<p>6. Inflection is a change in the form of a word indicating some
change in its meaning: as,—<i>boy</i>, <i>boy’s</i>; <i>man</i>, <i>men</i>; <i>drink</i>, <i>drank</i>.</p>

<p>7. Grammar is the science which treats of the forms and the
constructions of words.</p>

<p>Syntax is that department of grammar which treats of the constructions
of words.</p>

<p>8. The rules of grammar derive their authority from good usage,—that
is, from the customs or habits followed by educated speakers
and writers.</p>

<p class="summary"><b>Summary.</b> The Sentence: Subject and Predicate; Kinds of Sentences.—Use
of words in the Sentence: the Eight Parts of Speech; Infinitives

<h3>THE SENTENCE</h3>

<p id="s-1"><b>1.</b> <b>A sentence is a group of words which expresses a complete
thought.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Fire burns.</li>
  <li>Wolves howl.</li>
  <li>Rain is falling.</li>
  <li>Charles is courageous.</li>
  <li>Patient effort removes mountains.</li>
  <li>London is the largest city in the world.</li>
  <li>A man who respects himself should never condescend
  to use slovenly language.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these sentences are short, expressing a very simple
thought; others are comparatively long, because the thought
is more complicated and therefore requires more words for its
expression. But every one of them, whether short or long, is
complete in itself. It comes to a definite end, and is followed
by a full pause.</p>

<p id="s-2"><a id="page-2" href="#page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
<b>2.</b> Every sentence, whether short or long, consists of two
parts,—a <b>subject</b> and a <b>predicate</b>.</p>

<p><b>The subject of a sentence designates the person, place, or thing that
is spoken of; the predicate is that which is said of the subject.</b></p>

<p class="note">Thus, in the first example in <a href="#s-1">§&nbsp;1</a>, the subject is <i>fire</i> and the predicate
is <i>burns</i>. In the third, the subject is <i>rain</i>; the predicate, <i>is falling</i>. In
the last, the subject is <i>a man who respects himself</i>; the predicate, <i>should
never condescend to use slovenly language</i>.</p>

<p>Either the subject or the predicate may consist of a single
word or of a number of words. But neither the subject by
itself nor the predicate by itself, however extended, is a sentence.
The mere mention of a thing (<i>fire</i>) does not express a
complete thought. Neither does a mere assertion (<i>burns</i>), if
we neglect to mention the person or thing about which the
assertion is made. Thus it appears that both a subject and a
predicate are necessary to make a sentence.</p>

<p id="s-3"><b>3.</b> <b>Sentences may be declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory.</b></p>

<p id="s-3-1">1. <b>A declarative sentence declares or asserts something as a fact.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Dickens wrote “David Copperfield.”</li>
  <li>The army approached the city.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-3-2">2. <b>An interrogative sentence asks a question.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Who is that officer?</li>
  <li>Does Arthur Moore live here?</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-3-3">3. <b>An imperative sentence expresses a command or a request.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Open the window.</li>
  <li>Pronounce the vowels more distinctly.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-3-4">4. <b>An exclamatory sentence expresses surprise, grief, or some other
emotion in the form of an exclamation or cry.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>How calm the sea is!</li>
  <li>What a noise the engine makes!</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-3" href="#page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
A declarative, an interrogative, or an imperative sentence is
also <b>exclamatory</b>, if it is uttered in an intense or excited tone
of voice.</p>

<p id="s-4"><b>4.</b> In imperative sentences, the subject (<i>thou</i> or <i>you</i>) is
almost always omitted, because it is <b>understood</b> by both speaker
and hearer without being expressed.</p>

<p class="note">Such omitted words, which are present (<i>in idea</i>) to the minds of both
speaker and hearer, are said to be “understood.” Thus, in “Open the window,”
the subject is “<i>you</i> (understood).” If expressed, the subject would be
emphatic: as,—“<i>You</i> open the window.”</p>

<p id="s-5"><b>5.</b> The subject of a sentence commonly precedes the predicate,
but sometimes the predicate precedes.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Here comes Tom.</li>
  <li>Next came Edward.</li>
  <li>Over went the carriage.</li>
</ul>

<p>A sentence in which the predicate precedes the subject is
said to be in the <b>inverted order</b>. This order is especially common
in interrogative sentences.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Where is your boat?</li>
  <li>When was your last birthday?</li>
  <li>Whither wander you?<span class="attribution">—Shakspere.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>THE PARTS OF SPEECH</h3>

<p id="s-6"><b>6.</b> If we examine the words in any sentence, we observe
that they have different tasks or duties to perform in the
expression of thought.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Savage beasts roamed through the forest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this sentence, <i>beasts</i> and <i>forest</i> are the <b>names</b> of objects;
<i>roamed</i> <b>asserts action</b>, telling us what the beasts <i>did</i>; <i>savage</i>
<b>describes</b> the beasts; <i>through</i> shows the <b>relation</b> in thought between
<i>forest</i> and <i>roamed</i>; <i>the</i> <b>limits</b> the meaning of <i>forest</i>,
showing that one particular forest is meant. Thus each of
these words has its <b>special office</b> (or <b>function</b>) <b>in the sentence</b>.</p>

<p id="s-7"><a id="page-4" href="#page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
<b>7.</b> <b>In accordance with their use in the sentence, words are divided into
eight classes called parts of speech,—namely, nouns, pronouns, adjectives,
verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.</b></p>

<h4>I. NOUNS</h4>

<p id="s-8"><b>8.</b> <b>A noun is the name of a person, place, or thing.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Lincoln,</li>
    <li>William,</li>
    <li>Elizabeth,</li>
    <li>sister,</li>
    <li>engineer,</li>
    <li>Chicago,</li>
    <li>island,</li>
    <li>shelf,</li>
    <li>star,</li>
    <li>window,</li>
    <li>happiness,</li>
    <li>anger,</li>
    <li>sidewalk,</li>
    <li>courage,</li>
    <li>loss,</li>
    <li>song.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h4>II. PRONOUNS</h4>

<p id="s-9"><b>9.</b> <b>A pronoun is a word used instead of a noun. It designates a person,
place, or thing without naming it.</b></p>

<p class="note">In “<i>I</i> am ready,” the pronoun <i>I</i> is a convenient substitute for the
speaker’s name. In “<i>You</i> have forgotten <i>your</i> umbrella,” the pronouns
<i>you</i> and <i>your</i> designate the person to whom one is speaking.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title">Other pronouns are:</span>
  <ul>
    <li><i>he</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>him</i>;</li>
    <li><i>she</i>, <i>hers</i>, <i>her</i>;</li>
    <li><i>it</i>, <i>its</i>;</li>
    <li><i>this</i>, <i>that</i>;</li>
    <li><i>who</i>, <i>whose</i>, <i>whom</i>, <i>which</i>;</li>
    <li><i>myself</i>, <i>yourself</i>, <i>himself</i>, <i>themselves</i>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Since pronouns stand for nouns, they enable us to talk about
a person, place, or thing without constantly repeating the
name.</p>

<p id="s-10"><b>10.</b> <b>Nouns and pronouns are called substantives.</b></p>

<p>Nouns and pronouns are very similar in their use. The difference
between them is merely that the noun designates a
person, place, or thing by <b>naming</b> it, and that the pronoun
<b>designates</b>, but does not <b>name</b>. Hence it is convenient to have a
general term (<b>substantive</b>) to include both these parts of speech.</p>

<p id="s-11"><b>11.</b> <b>The substantive to which a pronoun refers is called its antecedent.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Frank</i> introduced the boys to <i>his</i> father. [<i>Frank</i> is the antecedent of
  the pronoun <i>his</i>.]</li>

  <li><i>Eleanor</i> is visiting <i>her</i> aunt.</li>

  <li>The <i>book</i> has lost <i>its</i> cover.</li>

  <li>The <i>trappers</i> sat round <i>their</i> camp fire.</li>
  <li><i>Washington</i> and <i>Franklin</i> served <i>their</i> country in different ways.
  [<i>Their</i> has two antecedents, connected by <i>and</i>.]</li>
</ul>
<a id="page-5" href="#page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>

<h4>III. ADJECTIVES</h4>

<p id="s-12"><b>12.</b> <b>An adjective is a word which describes or limits a substantive.</b><a href="#footnote-5" id="marker-5" class="marker" title="Footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>This it usually does by indicating some quality.</p>

<p><b>An adjective is said to belong to the substantive which it describes or
limits.</b></p>

<p id="s-13"><b>13.</b> An adjective limits a substantive by restricting the
range of its meaning.</p>

<p class="note">The noun <i>box</i>, for example, includes a great variety of objects. If we
say <i>wooden</i> box, we exclude boxes of metal, of paper, etc. If we use a
second adjective (<i>small</i>) and a third (<i>square</i>), we limit the size and the
shape of the box.</p>

<p>Most adjectives (like <i>wooden</i>, <i>square</i>, and <i>small</i>) <b>describe</b> as
well as limit. Such words are called <b>descriptive adjectives</b>.</p>

<p>We may, however, limit the noun <i>box</i> to a single specimen
by means of the adjective <i>this</i> or <i>that</i> or <i>the</i>, which does not
<b>describe</b>, but simply points out, or <b>designates</b>. Such words are
called <b>definitive adjectives</b>.<a href="#footnote-6" id="marker-6" class="marker" title="Footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<h4>IV. VERBS</h4>

<p id="s-14"><b>14.</b> <b>A verb is a word which can assert something (usually an action)
concerning a person, place, or thing.</b><a href="#footnote-7" id="marker-7" class="marker" title="Footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The wind <i>blows</i>.</li>
  <li>The horses <i>ran</i>.</li>
  <li>The fire <i>blazed</i>.</li>
  <li>Her jewels <i>sparkled</i>.</li>
  <li>Tom <i>climbed</i> a tree.</li>
  <li>The dynamite <i>exploded</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some verbs express state or condition rather than action.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The treaty still <i>exists</i>.</li>
  <li>The book <i>lies</i> on the table.</li>
  <li>Near the church <i>stood</i> an elm.</li>
  <li>My aunt <i>suffers</i> much from headache.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-15"><a id="page-6" href="#page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
<b>15.</b> A group of words may be needed, instead of a single
verb, to make an assertion.</p>

<p><b>A group of words that is used as a verb is called a verb-phrase.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You <i>will see</i>.</li>
  <li>The tree <i>has fallen</i>.</li>
  <li>We <i>might have invited</i> her.</li>
  <li>Our driver <i>has been discharged</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-16"><b>16.</b> Certain verbs, when used to make verb-phrases, are
called <b>auxiliary</b> (that is, “aiding”) <b>verbs</b>, because they help
other verbs to express action or state of some particular kind.</p>

<p class="note">Thus, in “You <i>will see</i>,” the auxiliary verb <i>will</i> helps <i>see</i> to express
<b>future</b> action; in “We <i>might have invited</i> her,” the auxiliaries <i>might</i> and
<i>have</i> help <i>invited</i> to express action that was <b>possible</b> in past time.</p>

<p>The auxiliary verbs are <i>is</i> (<i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>were</i>, etc.), <i>may</i>, <i>can</i>,
<i>must</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>should</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>had</i>, <i>do</i>,
<i>did</i>. Their forms and uses will be studied in connection with
the inflection of verbs.</p>

<p>The auxiliary verb regularly comes first in a verb-phrase,
and may be separated from the rest of it by some other word
or words.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Where <i>was</i> Washington <i>born</i>?</li>
  <li>The boat <i>was</i> slowly but steadily <i>approaching</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-17"><b>17.</b> <i>Is</i> (in its various forms) and several other verbs may
be used to frame sentences in which some word or words in
the predicate describe or define the subject.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. Gold <i>is</i> a metal.</li>
  <li>2. Charles <i>is</i> my friend’s name.</li>
  <li>3. The colors of this butterfly <i>are</i> brilliant.</li>
  <li>4. Iron <i>becomes</i> red in the fire.</li>
  <li>5. Our condition <i>seemed</i> desperate.</li>
  <li>6. Bertram <i>proved</i> a good friend in this emergency.</li>
  <li>7. My soul <i>grows</i> sad with troubles.<span class="attribution">—Shakspere.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the verb <i>is</i> not only <b>makes an assertion</b>,
but it also <b>connects</b> the rest of the predicate (<i>a metal</i>) with the
<a id="page-7" href="#page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
subject (<i>gold</i>) in such a way that <i>a metal</i> serves as a description
or definition of <i>gold</i>.</p>

<p>In sentences 4–7, <i>becomes</i>, <i>seemed</i>, <i>proved</i>, and <i>grows</i> are
similarly used.</p>

<p>In such sentences <i>is</i> and other verbs that are used for the
same purpose are called <b>copulative</b> (that is, “joining”) <b>verbs</b>.</p>

<p class="note"><i>Is</i> in this use is often called the <b>copula</b>, that is, the “joiner” or “link.”</p>

<p>The forms of the verb <i>is</i> are very irregular. Among the
commonest are: <i>am</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>were</i>, and the verb-phrases
<i>has been</i>, <i>have been</i>, <i>had been</i>, <i>shall be</i>, <i>will be</i>.<a href="#footnote-8" id="marker-8" class="marker" title="Footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h4>V. ADVERBS</h4>

<p id="s-18"><b>18.</b> <b>An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective, or
another adverb.</b></p>

<p class="note">To <b>modify</b> a word is to change or affect its meaning in some way.
Thus in “The river fell <i>rapidly</i>,” the adverb <i>rapidly</i> modifies the verb
<i>fell</i> by showing <i>how</i> the falling took place. In “I am <i>never</i> late,” “This
is <i>absolutely</i> true,” “That is <i>too</i> bad,” the italicized words are adverbs
modifying adjectives; in “He came <i>very</i> often,” “He spoke <i>almost</i> hopefully,”
“The river fell <i>too</i> rapidly,” they are adverbs modifying other
adverbs.</p>

<p>Most adverbs answer the question “How?” “When?”
“Where?” or “To what degree or extent?”</p>

<p id="s-19"><b>19.</b> Observe that adverbs modify verbs in much the same
way in which adjectives modify nouns.</p>

<table class="type-1" summary="">
  <tr>
    <th>Adjectives</th>
    <th>Adverbs</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A <i>bright</i> fire burned.</td>
    <td>The fire burned <i>brightly</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A <i>fierce</i> wind blew.</td>
    <td>The wind blew <i>fiercely</i>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><b>A word or group of words that changes or modifies the meaning of
another word is called a modifier.</b></p>

<p>Adjectives and adverbs, then, are both <b>modifiers</b>. Adjectives
modify substantives; adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or
other adverbs.</p>
<a id="page-8" href="#page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>

<h4>VI. PREPOSITIONS</h4>

<p id="s-20"><b>20.</b> <b>A preposition is a word placed before a substantive to show its
relation to some other word in the sentence.</b></p>

<p><b>The substantive which follows a preposition is called its object.</b></p>

<p>A preposition is said to <b>govern</b> its object.</p>

<p class="note">In “The surface <i>of</i> the water glistened,” <i>of</i> makes it clear that <i>surface</i>
belongs with <i>water</i>. In “Philip is <i>on</i> the river,” <i>on</i> shows Philip’s
position with respect to the river. <i>In</i>, or <i>near</i>, or <i>beyond</i> would have
indicated a different relation. <i>Water</i> is the object of the preposition <i>of</i>,
and <i>river</i> is the object of the preposition <i>on</i>.</p>

<p id="s-21"><b>21.</b> A preposition often has more than one object.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Over <i>hill</i> and <i>dale</i> he ran.</li>
  <li>He was filled with <i>shame</i> and <i>despair</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>VII. CONJUNCTIONS</h4>

<p id="s-22"><b>22.</b> <b>A conjunction connects words or groups of words.</b></p>

<p>A conjunction differs from a preposition in having no object,
and in indicating a less definite relation between the words
which it connects.</p>

<p class="note">
In “Time <i>and</i> tide wait for no man,” “The parcel was small <i>but</i>
heavy,” “He wore a kind of doublet <i>or</i> jacket,” the conjunctions <i>and</i>,
<i>but</i>, <i>or</i>, connect single words,—<i>time</i> with <i>tide</i>, <i>small</i> with <i>heavy</i>, <i>doublet</i>
with <i>jacket</i>. In “Do not go <i>if</i> you are afraid,” “I came <i>because</i> you sent
for me,” “Take my key, <i>but</i> do not lose it,” “Sweep the floor <i>and</i> dust
the furniture,” each conjunction connects the entire group of words
preceding it with the entire group following it.</p>

<h4>VIII. INTERJECTIONS</h4>

<p id="s-23"><b>23.</b> <b>An interjection is a cry or other exclamatory sound expressing
surprise, anger, pleasure, or some other emotion or feeling.</b></p>

<p>Interjections usually have no grammatical connection with
the groups of words in which they stand; hence their name,
which means “thrown in.”</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Oh!</i> I forgot.</li>
    <li><i>Ah</i>, how I miss you!</li>
    <li><i>Bravo!</i> <i>Alas!</i></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<a id="page-9" href="#page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>

<h4>THE SAME WORD AS DIFFERENT PARTS OF SPEECH</h4>

<p id="s-24"><b>24.</b> <b>The meaning of a word in the sentence determines to what part
of speech it belongs.</b></p>

<p><b>The same word may be sometimes one part of speech, sometimes
another.</b></p>

<p>Words of entirely separate origin, meaning, and use sometimes
look and sound alike: as in “The minstrel sang a
plaintive <i>lay</i>,” and “He <i>lay</i> on the ground.” But the following
examples (<a href="#s-25">§&nbsp;25</a>) show that the same word may have more
than one kind of grammatical office (or function). It is the
<b>meaning</b> which we give to a word <b>in the sentence</b> that determines
its classification as a part of speech.</p>

<p id="s-25"><b>25.</b> The chief classes of words thus variously used are
(1) nouns and adjectives, (2) nouns and verbs, (3) adjectives
and adverbs, (4) adjectives and pronouns, (5) adverbs and
prepositions.</p>

<h4>INFINITIVES AND PARTICIPLES</h4>

<p id="s-26"><b>26.</b> Two classes of verb-forms illustrate in a striking way
the fact that the same word may belong to different parts of
speech; for they really belong to two different parts of speech
at one and the same time. These are the <b>infinitive</b> (which is
both <b>verb</b> and <b>noun</b>) and the <b>participle</b> (which is both <b>verb</b> and
<b>adjective</b>).</p>

<p id="s-27"><b>27.</b> Examples of the <b>infinitive</b> may be seen in the following
sentences:</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>To struggle</i> was useless.</li>
  <li><i>To escape</i> is impossible.</li>
  <li><i>To exercise</i> regularly preserves the health.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>To struggle</i> is clearly a <b>noun</b>, for (1) it is the subject of the
sentence, and (2) the noun <i>effort</i> or <i>exertion</i> might be put in
the place of <i>to struggle</i>. Similarly, the noun <i>escape</i> might be
substituted for <i>to escape</i>; and, in the third sentence, <i>regular
exercise</i> (a noun modified by an adjective) might be substituted
for <i>to exercise regularly</i>.</p>

<p>But these three forms (<i>to struggle</i>, <i>to escape</i>, and <i>to exercise</i>)
are also <b>verbs</b>, for they express action, and one of them (<i>to exercise</i>)
is modified by an adverb (<i>regularly</i>). Such forms, therefore,
are noun-forms of the verb. They are classed with verbs,
and are called <b>infinitives</b>.</p>

<p id="s-28"><a id="page-12" href="#page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
<b>28.</b> <b>The infinitive is a verb-form which partakes of the nature of a
noun. It is commonly preceded by the preposition <i>to</i>, which is called the
sign of the infinitive.</b></p>

<p id="s-29"><b>29.</b> The infinitive without <i>to</i> is used in a great variety of
verb-phrases.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>shall go</i>.</li>
  <li>John <i>will win</i>.</li>
  <li>Mary <i>may recite</i>.</li>
  <li>Jack <i>can swim</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such phrases will be studied in connection with the inflection
of verbs.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> That <i>go</i>, <i>win</i>, <i>recite</i>, and <i>swim</i> are infinitives may be seen by comparing
the following sentences:—“I intend <i>to go</i>,” “John is sure <i>to win</i>,”
“Mary is permitted <i>to recite</i>,” “Jack is able <i>to swim</i>.”</p>

<p id="s-30"><b>30.</b> The following sentence contains two <b>participles</b>:—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>Shattered</i> and slowly <i>sinking</i>, the frigate drifted out to sea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this sentence, we recognize <i>shattered</i> as a form of the <b>verb</b>
<i>shatter</i>, and <i>sinking</i> as a form of the <b>verb</b> <i>sink</i>. They both express
action, and <i>sinking</i> is modified by the adverb <i>slowly</i>. But
<i>shattered</i> and <i>sinking</i> have also the nature of <b>adjectives</b>, for they
are used to describe the noun <i>frigate</i>. Such words, then, are
adjective forms of the verb. They are classed as verbs, and
are called <b>participles</b>, because they share (or participate in) the
nature of adjectives.</p>

<p id="s-31"><b>31.</b> <b>The participle is a verb-form which has no subject, but which
partakes of the nature of an adjective and expresses action or state in
such a way as to describe or limit a substantive.</b></p>

<p>A participle is said to <b>belong to</b> the substantive which it
describes or limits.</p>

<p id="s-32"><b>32.</b> The chief classes of participles are <b>present participles</b> and
<b>past participles</b>, so called from the time which they denote.</p>

<p>All present participles end in <i>ing</i>. Past participles have
several different endings, which will be studied in connection
with the inflection of verbs (<a href="#s-334">§&nbsp;334</a>).</p>

<p id="s-33"><a id="page-13" href="#page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
<b>33.</b> Participles are used in a variety of verb-phrases.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Tom <i>is coming</i>.</li>
  <li>Our boat <i>was wrecked</i>.</li>
  <li>I <i>have sent</i> the money.</li>
  <li>He <i>has brought</i> me a letter.</li>
  <li>Your book <i>is found</i>.</li>
  <li>They <i>have sold</i> their horses.</li>
  <li>You <i>have broken</i> your watch.</li>
  <li>The ship <i>had struck</i> on the reef.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such phrases will be studied in connection with the inflection
of verbs.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The double nature of the infinitive (as both verb and noun) and
the participle (as both verb and adjective) almost justifies one in classifying
each as a distinct part of speech (so as to make ten parts of speech instead of
eight). But it is more convenient to include them under the head of verbs, in
accordance with the usual practice.</p>

<h3>SIMPLE AND COMPLETE SUBJECT AND PREDICATE</h3>

<p id="s-34"><b>34.</b> Our survey of the eight parts of speech has shown, (1)
that these have very different offices or functions in the sentence,
and (2) that their functions are not of equal importance.</p>

<p>Clearly, the most important parts of speech are <b>substantives</b>
(nouns and pronouns) and <b>verbs</b>.</p>

<p>Substantives enable us to <b>name or designate</b> persons, places,
or things, and verbs enable us to <b>make statements</b> about them.
Both substantives and verbs, then, are absolutely necessary in
framing sentences. Without a substantive, there can be no
<b>subject</b>; without a verb, there can be no <b>predicate</b>: and both a
subject and a predicate, as we have seen, are needed to make
a sentence.</p>

<p><b>Adjectives</b> and <b>adverbs</b> are less important than substantives
and verbs. Their function is to <b>modify</b> other parts of speech,
that is, to change their meaning in some way. Thus adjectives
modify substantives (by describing or limiting), and adverbs
usually modify verbs (by indicating <i>how</i>, <i>when</i>, or <i>where</i> the
action took place). Without substantives, there would be no
use for adjectives; without verbs, there would be little use
for adverbs.</p>

<p><a id="page-14" href="#page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
<b>Prepositions</b> and <b>conjunctions</b> are also less important than substantives
and verbs. Their office is to connect and to show
relation. Of course, there would be no place for connectives
if there were nothing to connect.</p>

<p><b>Interjections</b> are the least important of all. They add liveliness
to language, but they are not actual necessities. We
could express all the thoughts that enter our minds without
ever using an interjection.</p>

<p id="s-35"><b>35.</b> A sentence may consist of but two words,—a noun or
pronoun (the subject) and a verb (the predicate). Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Charles | swims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commonly, however, either the subject or the predicate, or
both, will contain more than one word. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Young Charles | swims slowly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the <b>complete subject</b> (<i>young Charles</i>) consists of a noun
(<i>Charles</i>) and an adjective (<i>young</i>), which describes <i>Charles</i>.
The <b>complete predicate</b> consists of a verb (<i>swims</i>) and an adverb
(<i>slowly</i>), which modifies <i>swim</i> by indicating <i>how</i> the action is
performed. The subject noun (<i>Charles</i>) and the predicate verb
(<i>swims</i>) are the chief words in the sentence, for neither could
be omitted without destroying it. They form, so to speak, the
frame or skeleton of the whole. Either of the two modifiers,
the adjective or the adverb, or both, might be omitted, without
destroying the sentence; for this would still exist as the
expression of a thought (<i>Charles swims</i>), though the thought
would be less definite and exact than it is when the modifiers
are included.</p>

<p id="s-36"><b>36.</b> <b>The simple subject of a sentence is a noun or pronoun.</b></p>

<p><b>The simple predicate of a sentence is a verb or verb-phrase.</b></p>

<p><b>The simple subject, with such words as explain or complete its meaning,
forms the complete subject.</b></p>

<p><b>The simple predicate, with such words as explain or complete its
meaning, forms the complete predicate.</b></p>

<p><a id="page-15" href="#page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
In each of the following sentences the <b>complete subject</b> and
the <b>complete predicate</b> are separated by a vertical line, and the
<b>simple subject</b> and the <b>simple predicate</b> are printed in italics:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The <i>spider</i> | <i>spreads</i> her web.</li>

  <li>The fiery <i>smoke</i> | <i>rose</i> upward in billowing volumes.</li>

  <li>A nameless <i>unrest</i> | <i>urged</i> me forward.</li>

  <li>Our frantic <i>horses</i> | <i>swept</i> round an angle of the road.</li>

  <li>The <i>infirmities</i> of age | <i>came</i> early upon him.</li>

  <li>The general <i>feeling</i> among the English in Bengal | <i>was</i> strongly in
  favor of the Governor General.</li>

  <li><i>Salutes</i> | <i>were fired</i> from the batteries.</li>

  <li>The <i>Clives</i> | <i>had been settled</i> ever since the twelfth century on an
  estate of no great value near Market Drayton in Shropshire.</li>

  <li><i>I</i> | <i>have written</i> repeatedly to Mr. Hobhouse.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-37"><b>37.</b> Two or more simple subjects may be joined to make
one <b>compound subject</b>, and two or more simple predicates to
make one <b>compound predicate</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. <i>Charles</i> and <i>Henry</i> | play tennis well.</li>
  <li>2. <i>Moore</i> and <i>I</i> | passed some merry days together.</li>
  <li>3. <i>Frances</i> and <i>she</i> | are friends.</li>
  <li>4. <i>Hats</i>, <i>caps</i>, <i>boots</i>, and <i>gloves</i> | were piled together in confusion.</li>
  <li>5. The watch | <i>sank</i> and <i>was lost</i>.</li>
  <li>6. The balloon | <i>rose</i> higher and higher and finally <i>disappeared</i>.</li>
  <li>7. He | neither <i>smiled</i> nor <i>frowned</i>.</li>
  <li>8. <i>Snow</i> and <i>ice</i> | <i>covered</i> the ground and <i>made</i> our progress difficult.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-38"><b>38.</b> <b>A compound subject or predicate consists of two or more simple
subjects or predicates, joined, when necessary, by conjunctions.</b></p>

<p><b>Either the subject or the predicate, or both, may be compound.</b></p>

<p>In the first example in <a href="#s-37">§&nbsp;37</a>, two simple subjects (<i>Charles</i>
and <i>Henry</i>) are joined by the conjunction <i>and</i> to make a compound
subject. In the fourth, four substantives (<i>hats</i>, <i>caps</i>,
<i>boots</i>, <i>gloves</i>) form a series in which the last two are joined by
<i>and</i>. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh, the predicates are compound;
in the eighth, both the subject and the predicate.</p>

<p id="s-39"><b>39.</b> The following conjunctions may be used to join the members
of a compound subject or predicate: <i>and</i> (<i>both</i> ... <i>and</i>),
<i>or</i> (<i>either</i> ... <i>or</i>; <i>whether</i> ... <i>or</i>), <i>nor</i> (<i>neither</i> ... <i>nor</i>).</p>
<a id="page-16" href="#page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>

<h3>SUBSTITUTES FOR PARTS OF SPEECH</h3>

<h4>PHRASES</h4>

<p id="s-40"><b>40.</b> A group of words may take the place of a part of speech</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>The Father of Waters</i> is the Mississippi.</li>
  <li>A girl <i>with blue eyes</i> stood <i>at the window</i>.</li>
  <li>You <i>are looking</i> well.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><i>The Father of Waters</i> is used as a noun, since it names something.</p>

<p><i>With blue eyes</i> takes the place of an adjective (<i>blue-eyed</i>), and modifies
<i>girl</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the window</i> indicates, as an adverb might, where the girl stood,
and modifies <i>stood</i>.</p>

<p><i>Are looking</i> could be replaced by the verb <i>look</i>.</p>
</div>

<p id="s-41"><b>41.</b> <b>A group of connected words, not containing a subject and a
predicate, is called a phrase.</b></p>

<p><b>A phrase is often equivalent to a part of speech.</b></p>

<p id="s-41-1">1. A phrase used as a noun is called a <b>noun-phrase</b>.</p>

<p id="s-41-2">2. A phrase used as a verb is called a <b>verb-phrase</b>.</p>

<p id="s-41-3">3. A phrase used as an adjective is called an <b>adjective phrase</b>.</p>

<p id="s-41-4">4. A phrase used as an adverb is called an <b>adverbial phrase</b>.</p>

<p class="note">In the examples in <a href="#s-40">§&nbsp;40</a>, <i>The Father of Waters</i> is a noun-phrase; <i>with
blue eyes</i>, an adjective phrase; <i>at the window</i>, an adverbial phrase; <i>are
looking</i>, a verb-phrase.</p>

<p id="s-42"><b>42.</b> Many adjective and adverbial phrases consist of a
<b>preposition and its object</b>, with or without other words.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Your umbrella is <i>in the corner</i>.</li>
  <li>He has a heart <i>of oak</i>.</li>
  <li>A cup <i>with a broken handle</i> stood <i>on the shelf</i>.</li>
  <li>My house <i>of cards</i> fell <i>to the floor in a heap</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Adjective or adverbial phrases consisting of a preposition and its object,
with or without other words, may be called prepositional phrases.</b></p>

<h4>CLAUSES—COMPOUND AND COMPLEX SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-43"><b>43.</b> Phrases must be carefully distinguished from <b>clauses</b>.
The difference is that a clause contains a subject and a predicate
and a phrase does not.</p>

<p id="s-44"><a id="page-17" href="#page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
<b>44.</b> <b>A clause is a group of words that forms part of a sentence and
that contains a subject and a predicate.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The lightning flashed | and | the thunder roared.</li>
  <li>The train started | when the bell rang.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these sentences contains two clauses; but the relation
between the clauses in the first sentence is very different from
that between the clauses in the second.</p>

<p>In the first example, each of the two clauses makes a separate
and distinct statement, and might stand by itself as a
simple sentence,—that is, as a sentence having but one subject
and one predicate. These clauses are joined by the conjunction
<i>and</i>, which is not a part of either. No doubt the speaker feels
that there is some relation in thought between the two statements,
or he would not have put them together as clauses in
the same sentence. But there is nothing in the form of expression
to show what that relation is. In other words, the two
clauses are grammatically <b>independent</b>, for neither of them modifies
(or affects the meaning of) the other. The clauses are
therefore said to be <b>coördinate</b>,—that is, of the same “order”
or rank, and the sentence is called <b>compound</b>.</p>

<p>In the second example, on the contrary, the relation between
the two clauses is indicated with precision. One clause (<i>the
train started</i>) makes the main statement,—it expresses the
chief fact. Hence it is called the <b>main</b> (or <b>principal</b>) <b>clause</b>.
The other clause (<i>when the bell rang</i>) is added because the
speaker wishes to <b>modify</b> the main verb (<i>started</i>) by defining
the time of the action. This clause, then, is used as a <b>part of
speech</b>. Its function is the same as that of an adverb (<i>promptly</i>)
or an adverbial phrase (<i>on the stroke of the bell</i>). For this purpose
alone it exists, and not as an independent statement. Hence
it is called a <b>dependent</b> (or <b>subordinate</b>) <b>clause</b>, because it <b>depends</b>
(that is, “hangs”) upon the main clause, and so occupies a lower
or “subordinate” rank in the sentence. When thus constructed,
a sentence is said to be <b>complex</b>.</p>

<p id="s-45"><a id="page-18" href="#page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
<b>45.</b> An ordinary <b>compound sentence</b> (as we have seen in <a href="#s-44">§&nbsp;44</a>)
is made by joining two or more simple sentences, each of which
thus becomes an <b>independent coördinate clause</b>.</p>

<p>In the same way we may join two or more <b>complex sentences</b>,
using them as clauses to make one compound sentence:—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The train started when the bell rang, | and | Tom watched until the
last car disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="continued">This sentence is manifestly <b>compound</b>, for it consists of two
<b>coördinate clauses</b> (<i>the train started when the bell rang</i>; <i>Tom
watched until the last car disappeared</i>) joined by <i>and</i>. Each
of these two clauses is itself <b>complex</b>, for each could stand by
itself as a complex sentence.</p>

<p>Similarly, a <b>complex</b> and a <b>simple</b> sentence may be joined as
coördinate clauses to make a compound sentence.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The train started when the bell rang, | and | Tom gazed after it in
despair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a sentence, which is <b>compound in its structure</b>, but in
which one or more of the coördinate clauses are <b>complex</b>, is
called a <b>compound complex sentence</b>.<a href="#footnote-9" id="marker-9" class="marker" title="Footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p id="s-46"><b>46.</b> <b>A clause is a group of words that forms part of a sentence and
that contains a subject and a predicate.</b></p>

<p><b>A clause used as a part of speech is called a subordinate clause. All
other clauses are said to be independent.</b></p>

<p><b>Clauses of the same order or rank are said to be coördinate.</b></p>

<p><b>Sentences may be simple, compound, or complex.</b></p>

<p id="s-46-1">1. <b>A simple sentence has but one subject and one predicate, either or
both of which may be compound.</b></p>

<p id="s-46-2">2. <b>A compound sentence consists of two or more independent coördinate
clauses, which may or may not be joined by conjunctions.</b></p>

<p id="s-46-3">3. <b>A complex sentence consists of two or more clauses, one of which
is independent and the rest subordinate.</b></p>

<p><b>A compound sentence in which one or more of the coördinate clauses
are complex is called a compound complex sentence.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Iron rusts.</li>
  <li>George V is king.</li>
  <li>Dogs, foxes, and hares are quadrupeds. [Compound subject.]</li>
  <li>The defendant rose and addressed the court. [Compound predicate.]</li>
  <li>Merton and his men crossed the bridge and scaled the wall. [Both

</ul>

<h5>II. Compound Sentences</h5>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Shakspere was born in 1564; he died in 1616. [Two coördinate
  clauses; no conjunction.]</li>

  <li>A rifle cracked, and the wolf fell dead. [Two clauses joined by the

  <li>You must hurry, or we shall lose the train. [Two clauses joined by <i>or</i>.]</li>

  <li>James Watt did not invent the steam engine, but he greatly improved

  <li>Either you have neglected to write or your letter has failed to reach

</ul>

<p>The following conjunctions may be used to join coördinate
clauses: <i>and</i> (<i>both</i> ... <i>and</i>), <i>or</i> (<i>either</i> ... <i>or</i>), <i>nor</i> (<i>neither</i>
... <i>nor</i>), <i>but</i>, <i>for</i>.</p>

<h5>Clauses as Parts of Speech</h5>

<p id="s-47"><b>47.</b> <b>Subordinate clauses</b>, like phrases, are used as <b>parts of speech</b>.
They serve as substitutes for <b>nouns</b>, for <b>adjectives</b>, or for <b>adverbs</b>.</p>

<p id="s-47-1">1. <b>A subordinate clause that is used as a noun is called a noun (or
substantive) clause.</b></p>

<p id="s-47-2">2. <b>A subordinate clause that modifies a substantive is called an
adjective clause.</b></p>

<p id="s-47-3">3. <b>A subordinate clause that serves as an adverbial modifier is called
an adverbial clause.</b></p>

<b>48.</b> <span class="h5">I. Noun (or Substantive) Clauses.</span></p>

<p class="example">{<i>Success</i> | <i>That we should succeed in this plan</i>} is improbable.</p>

<p>The thought in these two sentences is the same, but in the second
it is more fully expressed. In the first sentence, the subject
is the noun <i>success</i>; in the second, the subject is the noun clause,
<i>that we should succeed in this plan</i>. This clause is introduced
by the conjunction <i>that</i>; the simple subject of the clause is the
pronoun <i>we</i>, and the simple predicate is the verb-phrase <i>should
succeed</i>. The first sentence is <b>simple</b>; the second is <b>complex</b>.</p>

<p>Substantive clauses are often introduced by the conjunction
<i>that</i>.</p>

<p id="s-49"><b>49.</b> <span class="h5">II. Adjective Clauses.</span> The following sentences illustrate

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The use of <b>phrases</b> and <b>clauses</b> as <b>parts of speech</b> increases enormously
the richness and power of language. Though English has a huge stock
of words, it cannot provide a separate noun or adjective or adverb for every
idea. By grouping words, however, in phrases and clauses we, in effect, make
a great variety of new nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, each precisely fitted to
the needs of the moment in the expression of thought.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF DEFINITIONS</h3>

<h4 class="summary">The Sentence</h4>

<p>1. Language is thought expressed in words.</p>

<p>2. To express thought words are combined into sentences.</p>

<p>3. A sentence is a group of words which expresses a complete
thought.</p>

<p>4. Sentences may be declarative, interrogative, imperative, or
exclamatory.</p>

<p>(1) A declarative sentence declares or asserts something as a fact.</p>

<p>(2) An interrogative sentence asks a question.</p>

<p>(3) An imperative sentence expresses a command or a request.</p>

<p>(4) An exclamatory sentence expresses surprise, grief, or some
other emotion in the form of an exclamation or cry.</p>

<p>A declarative, an interrogative, or an imperative sentence may also
be exclamatory.</p>
<a id="page-22" href="#page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>

<h4 class="summary">Subject and Predicate</h4>

<p>5. Every sentence consists of a subject and a predicate.</p>

<p>The subject of a sentence designates the person, place, or thing that
is spoken of; the predicate is that which is said of the subject.</p>

<p>6. The simple subject of a sentence is a noun or pronoun.</p>

<p>The simple predicate of a sentence is a verb or verb-phrase.</p>

<p>7. The simple subject, with such words as explain or complete its
meaning, forms the complete subject.</p>

<p>The simple predicate, with such words as explain or complete its
meaning, forms the complete predicate.</p>

<p>8. A compound subject or predicate consists of two or more simple
subjects or predicates, joined, when necessary, by conjunctions.</p>

<p>Either the subject or the predicate, or both, may be compound.</p>

<h4 class="summary">The Parts of Speech</h4>

<p>9. In accordance with their use in the sentence, words are divided
into eight classes called parts of speech,—namely, nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and
interjections.</p>

<p>(1) A noun is the name of a person, place, or thing.</p>

<p>(2) A pronoun is a word used instead of a noun. It designates a
person, place, or thing without naming it.</p>

<p>Nouns and pronouns are called substantives.</p>

<p>The substantive to which a pronoun refers is called its antecedent.</p>

<p>(3) An adjective is a word which describes or limits a substantive.</p>

<p>This it usually does by indicating some quality.</p>

<p>An adjective is said to belong to the substantive which it describes
or limits.</p>

<p>An adjective which describes is called a descriptive adjective; one
which points out or designates is called a definitive adjective.</p>

<p>(4) A verb is a word which can assert something (usually an
action) concerning a person, place, or thing.</p>

<p>Some verbs express state or condition rather than action.</p>

<p>A group of words that is used as a verb is called a verb-phrase.</p>

<p>Certain verbs, when used to make verb-phrases, are called auxiliary
(that is, “aiding”) verbs, because they help other verbs to express
action or state of some particular kind.</p>
<a id="page-23" href="#page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>

<p><i>Is</i> (in its various forms) and several other verbs may be used to
frame sentences in which some word or words in the predicate describe
or define the subject. In such sentences, <i>is</i> and other verbs
that are used for the same purpose are called copulative (that is,
“joining”) verbs.</p>

<p>(5) An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective, or
another adverb.</p>

<p>A word or group of words that changes or modifies the meaning
of another word is called a modifier.</p>

<p>Adjectives and adverbs are both modifiers.</p>

<p>(6) A preposition is a word placed before a substantive to show
its relation to some other word in the sentence.</p>

<p>The substantive which follows a preposition is called its object.</p>

<p>(7) A conjunction connects words or groups of words.</p>

<p>(8) An interjection is a cry or other exclamatory sound expressing
surprise, anger, pleasure, or some other emotion or feeling.</p>

<p>10. The meaning of a word in the sentence determines to what
part of speech it belongs.</p>

<p>The same word may be sometimes one part of speech, sometimes
another.</p>

<p>11. The infinitive is a verb-form which partakes of the nature of
a noun. It is commonly preceded by the preposition <i>to</i>, which is called
the sign of the infinitive.</p>

<p>12. The participle is a verb-form which has no subject, but which
partakes of the nature of an adjective and expresses action or state
in such a way as to describe or limit a substantive.</p>

<p>A participle is said to belong to the substantive which it describes
or limits.</p>

<p>The chief classes of participles are present participles and past
participles, so called from the time which they denote.</p>

<h4 class="summary">Substitutes for the Parts of Speech</h4>

<h5>Phrases</h5>

<p>13. A group of connected words, not containing a subject and
a predicate, is called a phrase.</p>

<p>A phrase is often equivalent to a part of speech.</p>

<p>(1) A phrase used as a noun is called a noun-phrase.</p>

<p>(2) A phrase used as a verb is called a verb-phrase.</p>

<p><a id="page-24" href="#page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>(3) A phrase used as an adjective is called an adjective phrase.</p>

<p>(4) A phrase used as an adverb is called an adverbial phrase.</p>

<p>14. Adjective or adverbial phrases consisting of a preposition and
its object, with or without other words, may be called prepositional
phrases.</p>

<h5>Clauses</h5>

<p>15. A clause is a group of words that forms part of a sentence and
that contains a subject and a predicate.</p>

<p>16. A clause used as a part of speech is called a subordinate clause.
All other clauses are said to be independent.</p>

<p>17. Clauses of the same order or rank are said to be coördinate.</p>

<p>18. Sentences may be simple, compound, or complex.</p>

<p>(1) A simple sentence has but one subject and one predicate, either
or both of which may be compound.</p>

<p>(2) A compound sentence consists of two or more independent
coördinate clauses, which may or may not be joined by conjunctions.</p>

<p>(3) A complex sentence consists of two or more clauses, one of
which is independent and the rest subordinate.</p>

<p>A compound sentence in which one or more of the coördinate
clauses are complex is called a compound complex sentence.</p>

<p>19. Subordinate clauses, like phrases, are used as parts of speech.
They serve as substitutes for nouns, for adjectives, or for adverbs.</p>

<p>(1) A subordinate clause that is used as a noun is called a noun
(or substantive) clause.</p>

<p>(2) A subordinate clause that modifies a substantive is called an
adjective clause.</p>

<p>(3) A subordinate clause that serves as an adverbial modifier is
called an adverbial clause.</p>

<h2>PART TWO<br />

<span class="subtitle">INFLECTION AND SYNTAX</span></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subtitle">INFLECTION</span></h3>

<p id="s-52"><b>52.</b> <b>Inflection is a change of form in a word indicating some change
in its meaning. A word thus changed in form is said to be inflected.</b></p>

<div class="note">
<p>Thus the nouns <i>man</i>, <i>wife</i>, <i>dog</i>, may change their form to <i>man’s</i>, <i>wife’s</i>,
<i>dog’s</i>, to express possession; or to <i>men</i>, <i>wives</i>, <i>dogs</i>, to show that two or
more are meant.</p>

<p>The pronouns <i>I</i>, <i>she</i>, may change their form to <i>our</i>, <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>The adjectives <i>large</i>, <i>happy</i>, <i>good</i>, may change their form to <i>larger</i>,
<i>happier</i>, <i>better</i>, to denote a higher degree of the quality; or to <i>largest</i>,
<i>happiest</i>, <i>best</i>, to denote the highest degree.</p>

<p>The verbs <i>look</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>sing</i>, may change their form to <i>looked</i>, <i>saw</i>, <i>sang</i>,
to denote past time.</p>
</div>

<p>The examples show that a word may be inflected (1) by the
addition of a final letter or syllable (<i>dog</i>, <i>dogs</i>; <i>look</i>, <i>looked</i>),
(2) by the substitution of one letter for another (<i>man</i>, <i>men</i>),
or (3) by a complete change of form (<i>good</i>, <i>better</i>, <i>best</i>).</p>

<p id="s-53"><b>53.</b> The inflection of a substantive is called its <b>declension</b>;
that of an adjective or an adverb, its <b>comparison</b>; that of a
verb, its <b>conjugation</b>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Some forms which we regard as due to inflection are really distinct
words. Thus <i>we</i> is regarded as a form of the pronoun <i>I</i>, but it is in fact an
altogether different word. Such irregularities, however, are not numerous,
and are properly enough included under the head of inflection.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="subtitle">NOUNS</span></h3>

<h4>CLASSIFICATION—COMMON NOUNS AND PROPER NOUNS</h4>

<p id="s-54"><b>54.</b> <b>A noun is the name of a person, place, or thing.</b></p>

<p id="s-55"><b>55.</b> <b>Nouns are divided into two classes—proper nouns and common
nouns.</b></p>

<p id="s-55-1">1. <b>A proper noun is the name of a particular person, place, or thing.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Lincoln,</li>
    <li>Napoleon,</li>
    <li>Ruth,</li>
    <li>Gladstone,</li>
    <li>America,</li>
    <li>Denver,</li>
    <li>Jove,</li>
    <li>Ohio,</li>
    <li>Monday,</li>
    <li>December,</li>
    <li>Yale,</li>
    <li>Christmas,</li>
    <li>Britannia,</li>
    <li>Niagara,</li>
    <li>Merrimac,</li>
    <li>Elmwood,</li>
    <li>Louvre,</li>
    <li>Richardson,</li>
    <li>Huron,</li>
    <li>Falstaff.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p id="s-55-2">2. <b>A common noun is a name which may be applied to any one of a
class of persons, places, or things.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>general,</li>
    <li>emperor,</li>
    <li>president,</li>
    <li>clerk,</li>
    <li>street,</li>
    <li>town,</li>
    <li>desk,</li>
    <li>tree,</li>
    <li>cloud,</li>
    <li>chimney,</li>
    <li>childhood,</li>
    <li>idea,</li>
    <li>thought,</li>
    <li>letter,</li>
    <li>dynamo,</li>
    <li>cruiser,</li>
    <li>dictionary,</li>
    <li>railroad.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Proper nouns begin with a capital letter; common nouns
usually begin with a small letter.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Although a proper noun is the name of a particular person, place,
or thing, that name may be given to more than one individual. More than one
man is named <i>James</i>; but when we say <i>James</i>, we think of one particular
person, whom we are calling by his own name. When we say <i>man</i>, on the
contrary, we are not calling any single person by name: we are using a noun
which applies, in common, to all the members of a large class of persons.</p>

<p>Any word, when mentioned merely <b>as a word</b>, is a noun.
Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>And</i> is a conjunction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-56"><b>56.</b> A common noun becomes a proper noun when used as
the particular name of a ship, a newspaper, an animal, etc.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Nelson’s flagship was the <i>Victory</i>.</li>
  <li>Give me this evening’s <i>Herald</i>.</li>
  <li>My dog is named <i>Rover</i>.</li>
  <li>The <i>Limited Express</i> is drawn by the <i>Pioneer</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-57"><a id="page-28" href="#page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
<b>57.</b> A proper noun often consists of a group of words, some
of which are perhaps ordinarily used as other parts of speech.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>James Russell Lowell,</li>
    <li>Washington Elm,</li>
    <li>Eiffel Tower,</li>
    <li>Firth of Clyde,</li>
    <li>North Lexington Junction,</li>
    <li>Stony Brook,</li>
    <li>Westminster</li>
    <li>Abbey,</li>
    <li>Measure for Measure,</li>
    <li>White House,</li>
    <li>Brooklyn Bridge,</li>
    <li>Atlantic Railroad,</li>
    <li>Sherman Act,</li>
    <li>The Return of the Native,</li>
    <li>Flatiron Building.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> These are (strictly speaking) noun-phrases (<a href="#s-41">§&nbsp;41</a>); but, since all are
particular names, they may be regarded as proper nouns.</p>

<p id="s-58"><b>58.</b> A proper noun becomes a common noun when used as a
name that may be applied to any one of a class of objects.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The museum owns two <i>Rembrandts</i> and a <i>Titian</i>.</li>
  <li>I exchanged my old motor car for a new <i>Halstead</i>.</li>
  <li>My fountain pen is a <i>Blake</i>.</li>
  <li>Lend me your <i>Webster</i>.</li>
  <li>He was a <i>Napoleon</i> of finance.</li>
  <li>I am going to buy a <i>Kazak</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-59"><b>59.</b> Certain proper nouns have become common nouns when
used in a special sense. These generally begin with a small
letter.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>macadam (crushed stone for roads, so called from Macadam, the inventor),</li>
    <li>mackintosh (a waterproof garment),</li>
    <li>napoleon (a coin),</li>
    <li>guinea (twenty-one shillings),</li>
    <li>mentor (a wise counsellor),</li>
    <li>derringer (a kind of pistol).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p id="s-60"><b>60.</b> A lifeless object, one of the lower animals, or any human
quality or emotion is sometimes regarded as a person.</p>

<p>This usage is called <b>personification</b>, and the object, animal, or
quality is said to be <b>personified</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p class="verse">Each old poetic <i>Mountain</i><br />
Inspiration breathed around.<span class="attribution">—Gray.</span></p>

<p class="verse">Who’ll toll the bell?<br />
“I,” said the <i>Bull</i>,<br />
“Because I can pull.”</p>

<p class="verse">His name was <i>Patience</i>.<span class="attribution">—Spenser.</span></p>

<p class="verse"><a id="page-29" href="#page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
Smiles on past <i>Misfortune’s</i> brow<br />
Soft <i>Reflection’s</i> hand can trace;<br />
And o’er the cheek of <i>Sorrow</i> throw<br />
<span class="i2">A melancholy grace.</span><span class="attribution">—Gray.</span></p>

<p class="verse"><i>Love</i> is and was my lord and king,<br />
<span class="i2">And in his presence I attend.</span><span class="attribution">—Tennyson.</span></p>

<p class="verse"><i>Time</i> gently shakes his wings.<span class="attribution">—Dryden.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The name of anything personified is regarded as a proper
noun and is usually written with a capital letter.</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> The rule for capitals is not absolute. When the personification is
kept up for only a sentence or two (as frequently in Shakspere), the noun
often begins with a small letter.</p>

<h5>SPECIAL CLASSES OF NOUNS</h5>

<p id="s-61"><b>61.</b> <b>An abstract noun is the name of a quality or general idea.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>blackness,</li>
    <li>freshness,</li>
    <li>smoothness,</li>
    <li>weight,</li>
    <li>height,</li>
    <li>length,</li>
    <li>depth,</li>
    <li>strength,</li>
    <li>health,</li>
    <li>honesty,</li>
    <li>beauty,</li>
    <li>liberty,</li>
    <li>eternity,</li>
    <li>satisfaction,</li>
    <li>precision,</li>
    <li>splendor,</li>

    <li>elegance,</li>
    <li>existence,</li>
    <li>grace,</li>
    <li>peace.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Many abstract nouns are derived from adjectives.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>greenness (from <i>green</i>),</li>
    <li>depth (from <i>deep</i>),</li>
    <li>freedom (from <i>free</i>),</li>
    <li>wisdom (from <i>wise</i>),</li>
    <li>rotundity (from <i>rotund</i>),</li>
    <li>falsity or falseness (from <i>false</i>),</li>
    <li>bravery (from <i>brave</i>).</li>

less used than formerly.</p>

manner of an adjective. Indeed, many expressions may be regarded either
(1) as compounds or (2) as phrases containing an adjective and a noun. Thus
<i>railway conductor</i> may be taken as a compound noun, or as a noun (<i>conductor</i>)
limited by an adjective (<i>railway</i>).</p>

<h4>INFLECTION OF NOUNS</h4>

<p id="s-65"><b>65.</b> In studying the inflection of nouns and pronouns we
have to consider <b>gender</b>, <b>number</b>, <b>person</b>, and <b>case</b>.</p>

<p id="s-65-1">1. <b>Gender is distinction according to sex.</b></p>

<p id="s-65-2">2. <b>Number is that property of substantives which shows whether
they indicate one person or thing or more than one.</b></p>

<p id="s-65-3">3. <b>Person is that property of substantives which shows whether they
designate (1) the speaker, (2) the person spoken to, or (3) the person or
thing spoken of.</b></p>

<p id="s-65-4">4. <b>Substantives have inflections of case to indicate their grammatical
relations to verbs, to prepositions, or to other substantives.</b></p>

<p class="note">
These four properties of substantives are included under inflection for convenience.
In strictness, however, nouns are inflected for number and case
only. Gender is shown in various ways,—usually by the meaning of the
noun or by the use of some pronoun. Person is indicated by the sense, by
the pronouns used, and by the form of the verb.</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> The feminine gender is often indicated by the ending <i>ess</i>. Frequently
the corresponding masculine form ends in <i>or</i> or <i>er</i>: as,—actor,
actress; governor, governess; waiter, waitress. The ending <i>ess</i> is not so
common as formerly. Usage favors <i>proprietor</i>, <i>author</i>, <i>editor</i>, etc., even for
the feminine (rather than the harsher forms <i>proprietress</i>, <i>authoress</i>, <i>editress</i>),
whenever there is no special reason for emphasizing the difference of sex.</p>

<p id="s-70-3">3. A few feminine words become masculine by the addition
of an ending. Thus,—<i>widow</i>, <i>widower</i>; <i>bride</i>, <i>bridegroom</i>.</p>

<p id="s-70-4">4. Gender is sometimes indicated by the ending <i>man</i>, <i>woman</i>,
<i>maid</i>, <i>boy</i>, or <i>girl</i>.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>salesman, saleswoman;</li>
    <li>foreman, forewoman;</li>
    <li>laundryman;</li>
    <li>milkmaid;</li>
    <li>cash boy, cash girl.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p id="s-70-5">5. A noun or a pronoun is sometimes prefixed to a noun to
indicate gender.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>manservant, maidservant;</li>
    <li>mother bird;</li>
    <li>cock sparrow, hen sparrow;</li>

    <li>he-wolf, she-wolf.</li>

</div>

<p id="s-70-6">6. The gender of a noun may be indicated by some accompanying
part of speech, usually by a pronoun.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>My <i>cat</i> is always washing <i>his</i> face.</li>
  <li>The <i>intruder</i> shook <i>her</i> head.</li>
  <li>I was confronted by a pitiful <i>creature</i>, haggard and <i>unshaven</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> The variations in form studied under 2 and 3 (above) are often regarded
as inflections. In reality, however, the masculine and the feminine
are different words. Thus, <i>baroness</i> is not an inflectional form of <i>baron</i>, but a
distinct noun, made from <i>baron</i> by adding the ending <i>ess</i>, precisely as <i>barony</i>
and <i>baronage</i> are made from <i>baron</i> by adding the endings <i>y</i> and <i>age</i>. The
process is rather that of <b>derivation</b> or noun-formation than that of inflection.</p>

<h5>II. NUMBER</h5>

<p id="s-71"><b>71.</b> <b>Number is that property of substantives which shows whether
they indicate one person, place, or thing or more than one.</b></p>

<p><b>There are two numbers,—the singular and the plural.</b></p>

<p><b>The singular number denotes but one person, place, or thing. The
plural number denotes more than one person, place, or thing.</b></p>

<p id="s-72"><b>72.</b> <b>Most nouns form the plural number by adding <i>s</i> or <i>es</i> to the
singular.</b></p>

<p>The two plurals sometimes differ in meaning: as,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Michael Angelo and Raphael were <i>geniuses</i>.</li>
  <li>Spirits are sometimes called <i>genii</i>.</li>
  <li>This book has two <i>indices</i>.</li>

<b>81.</b> When a <b>proper name</b> with the title <i>Mr.</i>, <i>Mrs.</i>, <i>Miss</i>, or
<i>Master</i>, is put into the plural, the rules are as follows:—</p>

<p id="s-81-1">1. The plural of <i>Mr.</i> is <i>Messrs.</i> (pronounced <i>Messers</i><a href="#footnote-14" id="marker-14" class="marker" title="Footnote 14"><sup>14</sup></a>). The
name remains in the singular. Thus,—</p>

<p class="example"><i>Mr. Jackson</i>, plural <i>Messrs.</i> (or the <i>Messrs.</i>) <i>Jackson</i>.</p>

<p id="s-81-2">2. <i>Mrs.</i> has no plural. The name itself takes the plural
form. Thus,—</p>

<p class="example"><i>Mrs. Jackson</i>, plural <i>the Mrs. Jacksons</i>.</p>

<p id="s-81-3">3. In the case of <i>Miss</i>, sometimes the title is put into the
plural, sometimes the name. Thus,—</p>

<p class="example"><i>Miss Jackson</i>, plural <i>the Misses Jackson</i> or <i>the Miss Jacksons</i>.</p>

<p class="note">
The latter expression is somewhat informal. Accordingly, it would not be
used in a formal invitation or reply, or in addressing a letter.</p>

<p id="s-81-4">4. The plural of <i>Master</i> is <i>Masters</i>. The name remains in
the singular. Thus,—</p>

<p class="example"><i>Master Jackson</i>, plural <i>the Masters Jackson</i>.</p>

<p class="note">
Other titles usually remain in the singular, the name taking the plural
form: as,—<i>the two General Follansbys</i>. But when two or more names follow,
the title becomes plural: as,—<i>Generals Rolfe and Johnson</i>.</p>

<p id="s-82"><b>82.</b> Some nouns, on account of their meaning, are seldom or
never used in the plural.</p>

<p class="note">
Such are many names of qualities (as <i>cheerfulness</i>, <i>mirth</i>), of sciences
(as <i>chemistry</i><a href="#footnote-15" id="marker-15" class="marker" title="Footnote 15"><sup>15</sup></a>), of forces (as <i>gravitation</i>).</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> These nouns were formerly plural in sense as well as in form. <i>News</i>,
for example, originally meant “new things.” Shakspere uses it both as a singular
and as a plural. Thus,—“<i>This news</i> was brought to Richard” (<i>King
John</i>, v. 3. 12); “But wherefore do I tell <i>these news</i> to thee?” (<i>1 Henry IV</i>,
iii. 2. 121). In a few words modern usage varies. The following nouns are
sometimes singular, sometimes plural: <i>alms</i>, <i>amends</i>, <i>bellows</i>, <i>means</i>, <i>pains</i>
(in the sense of “effort”), <i>tidings</i>.</p>

<h5>III. PERSON</h5>

<p id="s-85"><b>85.</b> <b>Person is that property of substantives which shows whether
they denote (1) the speaker, (2) the person spoken to, or (3) the person
spoken of.</b></p>

<p><b>A substantive is in the first person when it denotes the speaker, in
the second person when it denotes the person spoken to, in the third
person when it denotes the person or thing spoken of.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I, the <i>king</i>, command his presence. [First person.]</li>
  <li>You, <i>Thomas</i>, broke the window. [Second person.]</li>
  <li><i>Charles</i>, come here. [Second person.]</li>
  <li>He, the <i>fireman</i>, saved the train. [Third person.]</li>
  <li>The <i>diver</i> sinks slowly from our view. [Third person.]</li>
  <li>The <i>tower</i> suddenly collapsed. [Third person.]</li>
</ul>

<p>The examples show (1) that the person of a noun has nothing
to do with its form, but is indicated by the sense or connection;
(2) that certain pronouns denote person with precision.
Thus, <i>I</i> is always of the first person; <i>you</i> of the second; and
<i>he</i> of the third. These personal pronouns will be treated in
<a href="#II-3">Chapter III</a>.</p>
<a id="page-40" href="#page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>

<h5>IV. CASE</h5>

<p id="s-86"><b>86.</b> <b>Substantives have inflections of case to indicate their grammatical
relations to verbs, to prepositions, or to other substantives.</b></p>

<p>There are three cases,—the <b>nominative</b>, the <b>possessive</b>, and
the <b>objective</b>.</p>

<p class="note">The possessive case is often called the <b>genitive</b>.</p>

<p>The nominative and the objective case of a noun are always
alike in form. In some pronouns, however, there is a difference
(as,—<i>I</i>, <i>me</i>; <i>he</i>, <i>him</i>).</p>

<h6>Declension of Nouns</h6>

<p id="s-87"><b>87.</b> The inflection of a substantive is called its <b>declension</b>.
To <b>decline</b> a noun is to give its case-forms in order, first in the
singular number and then in the plural. Thus,—</p>

<h6>Nominative Case</h6>

<p id="s-88"><b>88.</b> The <b>nominative case</b> is used in the following constructions:
(1) the subject, (2) the predicate nominative, (3) the vocative,
(or nominative of direct address), (4) the exclamatory nominative,
(5) appositive with a nominative, (6) the nominative
absolute.</p>

<p id="s-88-1">1. <b>The subject of a verb is in the nominative case.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Water</i> freezes.</li>
  <li><i>Charles</i> climbed the mountain.</li>
  <li>The boy’s <i>face</i> glowed with health and exercise.</li>
  <li>A thousand <i>men</i> were killed in this battle.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the third example, <i>face</i> is the simple subject; the complete
subject is <i>the boy’s face</i>. In the fourth, <i>men</i> is the simple
subject; the complete subject is <i>a thousand men</i>. Both <i>face</i>
and <i>men</i> are in the nominative case; <i>face</i> is in the singular
number; <i>men</i> in the plural.</p>

<p id="s-88-2">2. <b>A substantive standing in the predicate, but describing or defining
the subject, agrees with the subject in case and is called a predicate
nominative.</b></p>

<p class="note">A predicate nominative is also called a <b>subject complement</b> or an <b>attribute</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Lobsters are <i>crustaceans</i>.</li>
  <li>A good book is a faithful <i>friend</i>.</li>
  <li>Shakspere was a <i>native</i> of Stratford-on-Avon.</li>
  <li>Arnold proved a <i>traitor</i>.</li>
  <li>Adams was elected <i>president</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rule for the case of the predicate nominative is particularly
important with respect to pronouns (<a href="#s-119">§&nbsp;119</a>).</p>

<table class="type-1" summary="">
  <tr>
    <td>I am <i>he</i>.</td>
    <td>Are you <i>she</i>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It is <i>I</i>.</td>
    <td>It was <i>we</i> who did it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The predicate nominative is commonest after the copula <i>is</i>
(in its various forms). It will be further studied in connection
with intransitive and passive verbs (<a href="#s-214">§§&nbsp;214</a>, <a href="#s-252">252</a>).</p>

<p id="s-88-3"><a id="page-42" href="#page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
3. <b>A substantive used for the purpose of addressing a person directly,
and not connected with any verb, is called a vocative.</b></p>

<p>A vocative is in the nominative case, and is often called a
<b>nominative by direct address</b> or a <b>vocative nominative</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Come, <i>Ruth</i>, give me your hand.</li>
  <li>Turn to the right, <i>madam</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Herbert</i>, it is your turn.</li>
  <li>Come with me, my <i>child</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> A vocative word is sometimes said to be <b>independent by direct
address</b>, because it stands by itself, unconnected with any verb. That a vocative
is really in the nominative case may be seen in the use of the pronoun
<i>thou</i> in this construction: as,—I will arrest thee, <i>thou</i> traitor (see <a href="#s-115">§&nbsp;115</a>).</p>

<p id="s-88-4">4. <b>A substantive used as an exclamation is called an exclamatory
nominative (or nominative of exclamation).</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Peace</i>, be still.</li>
  <li>Fortunate <i>Ruth</i>!</li>
  <li>A <i>drum</i>! a <i>drum</i>! Macbeth doth come.</li>
  <li>Look! a <i>balloon</i>!</li>
  <li>The <i>sun</i>! then we shall have a fine day.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Certain exclamatory nominatives are sometimes classed as interjections
(<a href="#s-375">§&nbsp;375</a>).</p>

<p id="s-88-5">5. <b>A substantive added to another substantive to explain it and signifying
the same person or thing, is called an appositive and is said to
be in apposition.</b></p>

<p><b>An appositive is in the same case as the substantive which it limits.</b></p>

<p>Hence a substantive in apposition with a nominative is in
the nominative case.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Mr. Scott, the <i>grocer</i>, is here. [Apposition with subject.]</li>
  <li>Tom, old <i>fellow</i>, I am glad to see you. [Apposition with vocative.]</li>
  <li>The discoverer of the Pacific was Balboa, a <i>Spaniard</i>. [Apposition
  with predicate nominative.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Apposition</i> means “attachment”; <i>appositive</i> means “attached
noun or pronoun.” An appositive modifies the noun with which it is in apposition
much as an adjective might do (compare “Balboa, a <i>Spaniard</i>” with
“<i>Spanish</i> Balboa”). Hence it is classed as an adjective modifier.</p>

<h6>Possessive Case</h6>

<p id="s-89"><b>89.</b> <b>The possessive case denotes ownership or possession.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>John’s</i> yacht lies at her moorings.</li>
  <li>The <i>duck’s</i> feet are webbed.</li>
  <li>The <i>mutineer’s</i> pistol burst when he fired.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Most uses of the possessive come under the general head of <b>possession</b>
in some sense. Special varieties of meaning are <b>source</b> (as in “<i>hen’s</i> eggs”)
and <b>authorship</b> (as in “<i>Wordsworth’s</i> sonnets”).</p>

<p>A possessive noun or pronoun modifies the substantive to which it is
attached as an adjective might do. Hence it is classed as an adjective
modifier.</p>

<p class="h7">Forms of the Possessive Case</p>

<p id="s-90"><b>90.</b> <b>The possessive case of most nouns has, in the singular number,
the ending <i>’s</i>.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>the owl’s feathers,</li>
    <li>Elizabeth’s hat,</li>
    <li>the officer’s name.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p><b>Plural nouns ending in <i>s</i> take no further ending for the possessive.
In writing, however, an apostrophe is put after the <i>s</i> to indicate the
possessive case.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>the owls’ feathers,</li>
    <li>the officers’ names,</li>
    <li>the artists’ petition,</li>
    <li>the engineers’ ball.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p><b>Plural nouns not ending in <i>s</i> take <i>’s</i> in the possessive.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>the firemen’s ball,</li>
    <li>the policemen’s quarters,</li>
    <li>the children’s hour.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English the possessive of most nouns was written as well
as pronounced with the ending <i>-es</i> or <i>-is</i>. Thus, in Chaucer, the possessive of
<i>child</i> is <i>childës</i> or <i>childis</i>; that of <i>king</i> is <i>kingës</i> or <i>kingis</i>; that of <i>John</i> is
<i>Johnës</i> or <i>Johnis</i>. The use of an apostrophe in the possessive is a comparatively
modern device, due to a misunderstanding. Scholars at one time
thought the <i>s</i> of the possessive a fragment of the pronoun <i>his</i>; that is, they
took such a phrase as <i>George’s book</i> for a contraction of <i>George his book</i>.
Hence they used the apostrophe before <i>s</i> to signify the supposed omission of
part of the word <i>his</i>. Similarly, in the possessive plural, there was thought
to be an omission of a final <i>es</i>; that is, such a phrase as <i>the horses’ heads</i> was
thought to be a contraction of the <i>horseses</i> heads. Both these errors have
long been exploded.</p>

<p id="s-91"><a id="page-44" href="#page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
<b>91.</b> Nouns like <i>sheep</i> and <i>deer</i>, which have the same form
in both the singular and the plural, usually take <i>’s</i> in the
possessive plural.</p>

<p class="note">Thus, <i>the deer’s tracks</i> would be written, whether one deer or more
were meant.</p>

<p id="s-92"><b>92.</b> <span class="smcap">Possessive Singular of Nouns ending in <i>s</i>.</span></p>

<p id="s-92-1">1. Monosyllabic nouns ending in <i>s</i> or an <i>s</i>-sound usually
make their possessive singular by adding <i>’s</i>.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Charles’s hat,</li>
    <li>Forbes’s garden,</li>
    <li>Mr. Wells’s daughter,</li>
    <li>Rice’s carriage,</li>
    <li>Mrs. Dix’s family,</li>
    <li>a fox’s brush.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> Most of these monosyllabic nouns in s are family names. The rule
accords with the best usage; but it is not absolute, for usage varies. Hence
forms like <i>Charles’</i> and <i>Wells’</i> cannot be condemned as positively wrong,
though <i>Charles’s</i> and <i>Wells’s</i> are preferable. In speaking, the shorter form is
often ambiguous, for there is no difference in sound between <i>Dix’</i> and <i>Dick’s</i>,
<i>Mr. Hills’</i> and <i>Mr. Hill’s</i>, <i>Dr. Childs’</i> and <i>Dr. Child’s</i>.</p>

<p id="s-92-2">2. Nouns of two or more syllables ending in <i>s</i> or an <i>s</i>-sound,
and not accented on the last syllable, may make their possessive
singular by adding <i>’s</i>, or may take no ending in the possessive.</p>

<p>In the latter case, an apostrophe is added in writing, but in
sound there is no difference between the possessive and the
nominative.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Burrows’s (<i>or</i> Burrows’) Hotel,</li>
    <li>Æneas’s (<i>or</i> Æneas’) voyage,</li>
    <li>Beatrice’s (<i>or</i> Beatrice’) gratitude,</li>
    <li>Felix’s (<i>or</i> Felix’) arrival,</li>
    <li>for conscience’s (<i>or</i> conscience’) sake.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Most of the nouns in question are proper names. In speaking,
one must often use the longer form to prevent ambiguity;
for <i>Williams’</i> and <i>William’s</i>, <i>Roberts’</i> and <i>Robert’s</i>, <i>Robbins’</i>
and <i>Robin’s</i>, are indistinguishable in sound.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Nouns of two or more syllables ending in <i>s</i> or an <i>s</i>-sound and accented
on the last syllable, follow the rule for monosyllables. Thus,—<i>Laplace’s</i>
mathematics (not <i>Laplace’</i>); <i>Alphonse’s</i> father (not <i>Alphonse’</i>).</p>

<p>When final <i>s</i> is silent (as in many French names), <i>’s</i> must of course be added
in the possessive. Thus,—<i>Descartes’s</i> philosophy (pronounced <i>Daycárt’s</i>).</p>
</div>
<a id="page-45" href="#page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>

<p class="h7">Use of the Possessive Case</p>

<p id="s-93"><b>93.</b><a href="#footnote-16" id="marker-16" class="marker" title="Footnote 16"><sup>16</sup></a> Possession may be denoted by a phrase with <i>of</i> as well
as by the possessive case. The distinction between the two
forms cannot be brought under rigid rules, but the following
suggestions will be of use.</p>

<p>I. In older English and in poetry the possessive case of
nouns is freely used, but in modern prose it is rare unless the
possessor is a living being. A phrase with <i>of</i> is used instead.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The mayor <i>of Detroit</i> (<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>Detroit’s</i> mayor).</li>
  <li>The top <i>of the post</i> (<span class="smaller">NOT</span> the <i>post’s</i> top).</li>
  <li>The prevalence <i>of the epidemic</i> (<span class="smaller">NOT</span> the <i>epidemic’s</i> prevalence).</li>
</ul>

<p>Contrast the poetic use:—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p class="verse"><i>Belgium’s</i> capital had gathered then<br />
Her beauty and her chivalry.<span class="attribution">—Byron.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">Other prepositions are sometimes used: as,—“the explosion in <i>New York</i>”
(<span class="smaller">NOT</span> “<i>New York’s</i> explosion”), “the station <i>at Plymouth</i>.”</p>

<p>II. When the possessor is a living being, good usage varies.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>1. If there is actual ownership or possession of some material thing, the
possessive case is generally used in the singular: as,—“John’s <i>hat</i>” (not
“the hat <i>of John</i>”). The possessive plural, however, is often replaced by
a phrase with <i>of</i>, to avoid ambiguity or harshness: as,—“the jewels
<i>of the ladies</i>” (rather than “the <i>ladies’</i> jewels”)<a href="#footnote-17" id="marker-17" class="marker" title="Footnote 17"><sup>17</sup></a>, “the wings <i>of the
geese</i>” (rather than “the <i>geese’s</i> wings”).</p>

<p>2. With nouns denoting a quality, an act, or the like, either the possessive
or the <i>of</i>-phrase is proper: as,—“<i>John’s</i> generosity,” or “the
generosity <i>of John</i>”; “<i>John’s</i> condition,” or “the condition <i>of John</i>”;
“the <i>guide’s</i> efforts,” or “the efforts <i>of the guide</i>”; “<i>Cæsar’s</i> death,” or
“the death <i>of Cæsar</i>.”</p>

<p>When there is any choice, it usually depends on euphony (that is, agreeable
sound), and is therefore a question of style. Sometimes, however,
there is a distinction in sense. “<i>John’s</i> fear,” for example, indicates that
John is afraid; but “the fear <i>of John</i>” means the fear which John inspires
in others.</p>
</div>

<p><a id="page-46" href="#page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
III. The following phrases are established idioms with the
possessive. In some of them, however, the possessive may be
replaced by <i>of</i> and its object.</p>

<ul class="example inline">
  <li>(1) The earth’s surface,</li>
  <li>the sun’s rays,</li>
  <li>the moon’s reflection,</li>
  <li>the pit’s mouth,</li>
  <li>a rope’s end,</li>
  <li>his journey’s end,</li>
  <li>at his wit’s end,</li>
  <li>the ship’s keel,</li>
  <li>the water’s edge,</li>
  <li>the cannon’s mouth,</li>
  <li>out of harm’s way,</li>
  <li>at swords’ points,</li>
  <li>for pity’s sake,</li>
  <li>for conscience’ sake;</li>
  <li>(2) a moment’s pause,</li>
  <li>a year’s time,</li>
  <li>a hand’s breadth,</li>
  <li>a boat’s length,</li>
  <li>a month’s salary,</li>
  <li>a week’s notice,</li>
  <li>a night’s rest,</li>
  <li>a day’s work,</li>
  <li>a stone’s throw,</li>
  <li>a feather’s weight,</li>
  <li>an hour’s delay,</li>
  <li>a dollar’s worth,</li>
  <li>not a foot’s difference.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
In the second group of phrases (“a moment’s pause,” etc.), the possessive
denotes not ownership, but <b>measure</b> or <b>extent</b>.</p>

<p>IV. The possessive case of certain pronouns (<i>my</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>your</i>,
<i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>their</i>) is more freely used than that of nouns in
expressions that do not denote actual ownership.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I know him to <i>my</i> sorrow. [Compare: to his loss, to our detriment,
  to his advantage.]</li>
  <li>The brass has lost <i>its</i> polish.</li>
  <li>This question must be decided on <i>its</i> merits.</li>
  <li>His arguments did not fail of <i>their</i> effect.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
For the inflection of these pronouns, see <a href="#s-115">§&nbsp;115</a>. For the use of <i>whose</i>, see <a href="#s-152">§&nbsp;152</a>.</p>

<p id="s-94"><b>94.</b> When a thing belongs to two or more <b>joint owners</b>, the
sign of the possessive is added to the last name only.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Brown, Jones, and Richardson’s factories. [Brown, Jones, and Richardson
  are partners.]</li>

  <li>It is George and William’s turn to take the boat. [George and William
  are to go in the boat together.]</li>

  <li>On the other hand, in order to avoid ambiguity we should say,
  “Brown’s, Jones’s, and Richardson’s factories,” if each individual had
  a factory of his own; and “George’s and William’s answers were correct,”
  if each boy answered independently of the other.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-95"><b>95.</b> In <b>compound nouns</b> the last part takes the possessive
sign. So also when a phrase is used as a noun.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>My <i>father-in-law’s</i> home is in Easton.</li>
  <li>We had <i>a quarter of an hour’s</i> talk.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-47" href="#page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
Other examples are the following:—</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <ul>
    <li>My brother-in-law’s opinion;</li>
    <li>the commander-in-chief’s orders;</li>
    <li>the lady-in-waiting’s duties;</li>
    <li>the coal dealer’s prices;</li>
    <li>Edward VII’s reign;</li>
    <li>the King of England’s portrait;</li>
    <li>half a year’s delay;</li>
    <li>in three or four months’ time;</li>
    <li>a cable and a half’s length;</li>
    <li>the pleasure of Major Pendennis and Mr. Arthur Pendennis’s company (<span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Noun-phrases often contain two substantives, the second of which
is in apposition with the first. In such phrases, <i>of</i> is generally preferable to
the possessive. Thus, we may say either “Tom the blacksmith’s daughter” or
“the daughter of Tom the blacksmith”; but “the son of Mr. Hill the carpenter”
is both neater and clearer than “Mr. Hill the carpenter’s son.” The use
of <i>’s</i> is also avoided with a very long phrase like “the owner of the house on
the other side of the street.”</p>

<p>An objective may stand in apposition with a possessive, the latter being
equivalent to <i>of</i> with an object. Thus,—“I am not yet of Percy’s mind [= of
the mind of Percy], the <i>Hotspur</i> of the North” (<span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>).</p>
</div>

<p id="s-96"><b>96.</b> The noun denoting the object possessed is often omitted
when it may be readily understood, especially in the predicate.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Conant’s</i> [shop] is open until noon.</li>
  <li>I buy my hats at <i>Bryant’s</i> [shop].</li>
  <li>We will dine at <i>Pennock’s</i> [restaurant].</li>
  <li>That camera is <i>mine</i>. (See <a href="#s-122">§&nbsp;122</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This construction is common in such expressions as:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He was a relative of <i>John’s</i>.</li>
  <li>That careless tongue of <i>John’s</i> will get him into trouble.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
In the first example, “a relative of John’s” means “a relative of (= <i>from
among</i>) John’s relatives.” The second example shows an extension of this
construction by analogy. See <a href="#s-122">§&nbsp;122</a>.</p>

<h6>Objective Case</h6>

<p id="s-97"><b>97.</b> The <b>objective case</b>, as its name implies, is the case of the
<b>object</b>. Most of its uses are covered by the following rule:—</p>

<p><b>The object of a verb or preposition is in the objective case.</b></p>

<p>The object of a preposition has already been explained and
defined (<a href="#s-20">§§&nbsp;20–21</a>).</p>

<p id="s-98"><a id="page-48" href="#page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
<b>98.</b> The <b>object of a verb</b> may be (1) the direct object, (2) the
predicate objective, (3) the indirect object, (4) the cognate object.
Of these the direct object is the most important.</p>

<p>The objective is also used (5) adverbially (<a href="#s-109">§&nbsp;109</a>), (6) in apposition
with another objective (<a href="#s-110">§&nbsp;110</a>), and (7) as the subject
of an infinitive (<a href="#s-111">§&nbsp;111</a>).</p>

<h5>1. Direct Object</h5>

<p id="s-99"><b>99.</b> <b>Some verbs may be followed by a substantive denoting that
which receives the action or is produced by it. These are called transitive
verbs. All other verbs are called intransitive.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. That man <i>struck</i> my <i>dog</i>.</li>
  <li>2. The arrow <i>hit</i> the <i>target</i>.</li>
  <li>3. Cæsar <i>conquered Gaul</i>.</li>
  <li>4. Mr. Holland <i>sells flour</i>.</li>
  <li>5. The farmer <i>raises corn</i>.</li>
  <li>6. Mr. Eaton <i>makes stoves</i>.</li>
  <li>7. My grandfather <i>built</i> that <i>house</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Nos. 1–4, the verb is followed by a noun denoting the
<b>receiver of the action</b>. Thus, in the first sentence, the <i>dog</i> receives
the blow; in the second, the <i>target</i> receives the action of hitting.
In Nos. 5–7, the verb is followed by a noun denoting the
<b>product</b> of the action. For example, the <i>corn</i> is <b>produced</b> by the
action expressed by the verb <i>raises</i>.</p>

<p>In each example, the noun that follows the verb <b>completes
the sense</b> of the verb. “That man <i>struck</i> ——.” “Struck
<i>whom</i>?” “He struck the <i>dog</i>.” Until <i>dog</i> is added the sense
of the verb <i>struck</i> is incomplete.</p>

<p id="s-100"><b>100.</b> <b>A substantive that completes the meaning of a transitive verb
is called its direct object, and is said to be in the objective case.</b></p>

<div class="note">
<p>Thus, in the examples above, <i>dog</i> is the direct object of the transitive
verb <i>struck</i>; <i>target</i> is the direct object of <i>hit</i>,—and so on. Each of these
nouns is therefore in the <b>objective case</b>.</p>

<p><b>The direct object is often called the object complement, or the object of the
verb.</b></p>
</div>

<p id="s-101"><a id="page-49" href="#page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
<b>101.</b> Intransitive verbs have no object.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The lion <i>roared</i>.</li>
  <li>The visitor <i>coughed</i> gently.</li>
  <li>The log <i>drifted</i> downstream.</li>
  <li>We all <i>listened</i> intently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare these sentences with those in <a href="#s-99">§&nbsp;99</a>. We observe
that the verbs (unlike those in <a href="#s-99">§&nbsp;99</a>) admit no object, since
their meaning is complete without the addition of any noun
to denote the receiver or product of the action. “The man
<i>struck</i>——” prompts the inquiry, “Struck <i>whom</i>?” But no
such question is suggested by “The lion <i>roared</i>”; for “Roared
<i>what</i>?” would be an absurdity.</p>

<p id="s-102"><b>102.</b> The <b>predicate nominative</b> (<a href="#s-88-2">§&nbsp;88, 2</a>) must not be confused
with the <b>direct object</b>. They resemble each other in two particulars:
(1) both stand in the predicate, and (2) both complete
the meaning of the verb. But they differ utterly in their
relation to the subject of the sentence. For—</p>

<p>The <b>predicate nominative</b> describes or defines the <b>subject</b>. Hence
both substantives denote the same person or thing.</p>

<p class="example">
Charles [<span class="smaller">SUBJECT</span>] {is | was | became | was elected}
<i>captain</i> [<span class="smaller">PREDICATE NOMINATIVE</span>].
</p>

<p>The <b>direct object</b> neither describes nor defines the subject.
On the contrary, it designates that upon which the subject
acts. Hence the two substantives regularly<a href="#footnote-18" id="marker-18" class="marker" title="Footnote 18"><sup>18</sup></a> denote different
persons or things.</p>

<p class="example">
Charles [<span class="smaller">SUBJECT</span>]
{struck <i>James</i> [<span class="smaller">OBJECT</span>].
| threw a <i>stone</i> [<span class="smaller">OBJECT</span>].
| built a <i>boat</i> [<span class="smaller">OBJECT</span>].}
</p>

<p>Both the direct object and the predicate nominative are
classed as <b>complements</b>, because they are used to complete the
sense of the predicate verb (<a href="#s-483">§&nbsp;483</a>).</p>

<p id="s-103"><a id="page-50" href="#page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
<b>103.</b> A verb of <i>asking</i> sometimes takes <b>two direct objects</b>, one
denoting the <b>person</b> and the other the <b>thing</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>She asked the <i>boy</i> his <i>name</i>.</li>
  <li>Ask <i>me</i> no <i>favors</i>.</li>
  <li>I asked the <i>lawyer</i> his <i>opinion</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h5>2. Predicate Objective</h5>

<p id="s-104"><b>104.</b> <b>Verbs of <i>choosing</i>, <i>calling</i>, <i>naming</i>, <i>making</i>, and <i>thinking</i> may take
two objects referring to the same person or thing.</b></p>

<p><b>The first of these is the direct object, and the second, which completes
the sense of the predicate, is called a predicate objective.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>We chose Oscar <i>president</i>. [<i>Oscar</i> is the direct object of <i>chose</i>; <i>president</i>
  is the predicate objective.]</li>

  <li>I call John my <i>friend</i>.</li>

  <li>They thought the man a <i>coward</i>.</li>

  <li>Make my house your <i>home</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The predicate objective is often called the complementary object or the objective
attribute. It is classed as a complement.</p>

<p>An adjective may serve as predicate objective.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I call this ship <i>unseaworthy</i>.</li>
  <li>Your letter made your sister <i>anxious</i>.</li>
  <li>What makes Edwin so <i>careless</i>?</li>
</ul>

<h5>3. Indirect Object and Similar Idioms</h5>

<p id="s-105"><b>105.</b> <b>Some verbs of <i>giving</i>, <i>telling</i>, <i>refusing</i>, and the like, may take two
objects, a direct object and an indirect object.</b></p>

<p><b>The indirect object denotes the person or thing toward whom or
toward which is directed the action expressed by the rest of the predicate.</b></p>

  <li>spare,</li>
  <li>teach,</li>
  <li>tell,</li>
  <li>throw,</li>
  <li>toss,</li>
  <li>vouchsafe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pronouns are commoner as indirect objects than nouns.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>They denied <i>her</i> the necessities of life.</li>
  <li>I guaranteed <i>them</i> a handsome profit.</li>
  <li>The king vouchsafed <i>them</i> an audience.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>It is always possible to insert the preposition <i>to</i> before the indirect
object without changing the sense.</b></p>

<p>Since the indirect object is equivalent to an adverbial phrase,
it is classed as a modifier of the verb.</p>

<p class="note">
Thus, in “Dick sold <i>John</i> his bicycle,” <i>John</i> is an adverbial modifier
of the predicate verb <i>sold</i>.</p>

<p>The indirect object is sometimes used without a direct object
expressed. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>He paid the hatter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">Here <i>hatter</i> may be recognized as an indirect object by inserting <i>to</i> before
it and adding a direct object (“his <i>bill</i>,” “his <i>money</i>,” or the like).</p>

<p id="s-106"><b>106.</b> The objective case sometimes expresses the person <i>for
whom</i> anything is done.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>William made his <i>brother</i> a kite [= made a kite for his brother].</li>
  <li>Sampson built <i>me</i> a boat [= built a boat for me].</li>
</ul>

<p>This construction may be called the <b>objective of service</b>.</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> The objective of service is often included under the head of the
indirect object. But the two constructions differ widely in sense, and should
be carefully distinguished. To do an act <i>to</i> a person is not the same thing as
to do an act <i>for</i> a person. Contrast “John paid the money <i>to</i> me,” with “John
paid the money <i>for</i> me”; “Dick sold a bicycle <i>to</i> me,” with “Dick sold a
bicycle <i>for</i> me.”</p>

<p id="s-107"><a id="page-52" href="#page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
<b>107.</b> The objective case is used after <i>like</i>, <i>unlike</i>, <i>near</i>, and
<i>next</i>, which are really adjectives or adverbs, though in this
construction they are often regarded as prepositions.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>She sang like a <i>bird</i>. [<i>Like</i> is an adverb.]</li>
  <li>The earth is like a <i>ball</i>. [<i>Like</i> is an adjective.]</li>
  <li>My office is near the <i>station</i>. [<i>Near</i> is an adjective.]</li>
  <li>That answer was unlike <i>Joseph</i>. [<i>Unlike</i> is an adjective.]</li>
  <li>This man walks unlike <i>Joseph</i>. [<i>Unlike</i> is an adverb.]</li>
  <li>A stream ran near the <i>hut</i>. [<i>Near</i> is an adverb.]</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of the objective after these words is a peculiar idiom
similar to the indirect object (<a href="#s-105">§&nbsp;105</a>). The nature of the construction
may be seen (as in the indirect object) by inserting
<i>to</i> or <i>unto</i> (“She sang <i>like unto</i> a bird”).</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> The indirect object, the objective of service, and the objective after
<i>like</i>, <i>unlike</i>, and <i>near</i> are all survivals of old dative constructions. Besides
the case of the direct object (often called <b>accusative</b>), English once had a case
(called the <b>dative</b>) which meant <i>to</i> or <i>for</i> [somebody or something]. The dative
case is easily distinguished in Greek, Latin, and German, but in English it
has long been merged in form with the ordinary objective.</p>

<h5>4. Cognate Object</h5>

<p id="s-108"><b>108.</b> <b>A verb that is regularly intransitive sometimes takes as object
a noun whose meaning closely resembles its own.</b></p>

<p><b>A noun in this construction is called the cognate object of the verb
and is in the objective case.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He ran a <i>race</i>.</li>
  <li>The mayor coughed a dubious, insinuating <i>cough</i>.</li>
  <li>A scornful <i>laugh</i> laughed he.</li>
  <li>The trumpeter blew a loud <i>blast</i>.</li>
  <li>She sleeps the <i>sleep</i> of death.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Cognate</i> means “kindred” or “related.” The cognate object repeats
the idea of the verb, often with some modification, and may be classed
as an adverbial modifier. Its difference from the direct object may be seen
by contrasting “The blacksmith struck the <i>anvil</i>” with “The blacksmith
struck a mighty <i>blow</i>” (cf. “struck <i>mightily</i>”). For the pronoun <i>it</i> as cognate
object, see <a href="#s-120">§&nbsp;120</a>.</p>
<a id="page-53" href="#page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>

<h5>5. Adverbial Objective</h5>

<p id="s-109"><b>109.</b> <b>A noun, or a phrase consisting of a noun and its modifiers, may
be used adverbially. Such a noun is called an adverbial objective.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>We have waited <i>years</i> for this reform.</li>
  <li>I am <i>years</i> older than you are.</li>
  <li>The river is <i>miles</i> away.</li>
  <li>The water rose <i>three feet</i>.</li>
  <li>This is <i>an inch</i> too long.</li>
  <li>My brother is <i>twenty years</i> old.</li>
  <li>I will stay a <i>short time</i>.</li>
  <li>Wait <i>a moment</i>.</li>
  <li>Come here <i>this instant</i>!</li>
  <li>Turn your eyes <i>this way</i>.</li>
  <li>This silk is <i>several shades</i> too light.</li>
</ul>

<p>A group of words consisting of an adverbial object with its
modifier or modifiers forms an <b>adverbial phrase</b> (<a href="#s-41">§&nbsp;41</a>).</p>

<h5>6. Objective in Apposition</h5>

<p id="s-110"><b>110.</b> A substantive in apposition with an objective is itself
in the objective case.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Yesterday I saw Williams the <i>expressman</i>. [Apposition with the direct
  object of <i>saw</i>.]</li>

  <li>Tom gave his friend <i>John</i> a book. [Apposition with the indirect object
  <i>friend</i>.]</li>

  <li>He lives with Andrews the <i>blacksmith</i>. [Apposition with the object of
  the preposition <i>with</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p>This rule follows from the general principle that an appositive
is in the same case as the substantive to which it is
attached (<a href="#s-88-5">§&nbsp;88, 5</a>).</p>

<h5>7. Subject of an Infinitive</h5>

<p id="s-111"><b>111.</b> The subject of an infinitive is in the objective case.</p>

<p>This construction will be treated in connection with the uses
of the infinitive (<a href="#s-325">§&nbsp;325</a>).</p>
<a id="page-54" href="#page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>

<h5>Parsing</h5>

<p id="s-112"><b>112.</b> To <b>parse</b> a word is to describe its grammatical form
and to give its construction.</p>

<p>In parsing a <b>noun</b>, we mention the class to which it belongs,
give its gender, number, person, and case, and tell why it is in
that case. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>1. Frank shot a wolf.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="note">
<p><i>Frank</i> is a proper noun of the masculine gender, in the singular number
and third person. It is in the nominative case, because it is the subject
of the verb <i>shot</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i> is a common noun of the masculine or feminine [or common]
gender, in the singular number and third person. It is in the objective
case, because it is the object [or direct object] of the transitive verb <i>shot</i>.</p>
</div>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>2. Jane, come here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>Jane</i> is a proper noun of the feminine gender, in the singular number
and second person. It is in the nominative case, being used as a vocative
(or in direct address).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>3. The rope is fifteen feet long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>Feet</i> is a common noun of the neuter gender, in the plural number
and third person. It is in the objective case, being used as an adverbial
modifier of the adjective <i>long</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>4. Edgar’s boat is a sloop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>Edgar’s</i> is a proper noun of the masculine gender, in the singular
number and third person. It is in the possessive case, modifying the
noun <i>boat</i>.</p>

<p>Unlike nouns, most of the personal pronouns have distinct
forms for the nominative and the objective.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The possessive case of personal pronouns never has the apostrophe.
Thus,—<i>its</i>, <i>yours</i>, <i>theirs</i>.</p>

<p>The form <i>it’s</i> is proper only as a contraction of <i>it is</i>.</p>
</div>

<h5>GENDER AND NUMBER</h5>

<p id="s-116"><b>116.</b> The pronouns of the first and second persons (<i>I</i> and
<i>thou</i>) may be either masculine or feminine.</p>

<p>The pronouns of the third person have different forms for
masculine, feminine, and neuter in the <b>singular</b> (<i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, <i>it</i>);
but in the <b>plural</b> the form <i>they</i> serves for all three genders.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In the oldest English <i>his</i> was both masculine and neuter. The
neuter use lasted until the seventeenth century. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p class="verse">That same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br />
Did lose <i>his</i> lustre.<span class="attribution">—Shakspere</span>, <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, i. 2. 123.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p id="s-117"><b>117.</b> <i>Thou</i>, <i>thy</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>thee</i>, and <i>ye</i> are old forms still found
in poetry and the solemn style.</p>

<p>In ordinary prose, <i>you</i>, <i>your</i>, and <i>yours</i> are the only forms
used for the second person, whether singular or plural. Yet
<i>you</i>, even when denoting a single person, always takes the verb-forms
that go with plural subjects. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>My friend, <i>you were</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>was</i>] in error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence <i>you</i> may best be regarded as always plural in form, but
may be described as singular in sense when it stands for one
person only.</p>
<a id="page-57" href="#page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Members of the Society of Friends (commonly called Quakers) and
of some other religious bodies use <i>thee</i> and <i>thy</i> in their ordinary conversation.</p>

<p><i>Ye</i> was formerly the regular nominative plural, and <i>you</i> the objective;
but the forms were afterwards confused. <i>Ye</i> has gone out of use except in
poetry and the solemn style, and <i>you</i> is now the regular form for both nominative
and objective.</p>

<p>Where an objective form <i>ye</i> is found printed instead of <i>you</i> (as often in
Shakspere,—“A southwest blow on <i>ye</i>”), it represents an indistinct pronunciation
of <i>you</i> rather than the old nominative <i>ye</i>. This indistinct sound may
still be heard in rapid or careless speech (“I’ll tell yer the truth”).</p>

<p><i>Ye</i> as an abbreviation for <i>the</i> (as in “<i>ye</i> old town”) has nothing to do with
the pronoun <i>ye</i>. The <i>y</i> simply stands for the character þ (an old sign for <i>th</i>),
and the abbreviation was pronounced <i>the</i>, never <i>ye</i>.</p>
</div>

<p id="s-118"><b>118.</b> <i>They</i>, <i>you</i>, and <i>we</i> are often used indefinitely for “one”
or “people in general.”</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>They</i> say that Joe has gone to sea.</li>
  <li>To shut off the steam, <i>you</i> close both valves of the radiator.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>We</i>, <i>our</i>, and <i>us</i> are used in editorial articles instead of <i>I</i>, <i>my</i>, and
<i>me</i>, because the writer represents the whole editorial staff. This practice
should not be followed in ordinary composition.</p>

<p>A sovereign ruler may use <i>we</i>, <i>our</i>, and <i>us</i> when speaking of himself in
proclamations and other formal documents. This construction is often called
“the plural of majesty.” Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p class="verse">Know that <i>we</i> have divided<br />
In three <i>our</i> kingdom.<span class="attribution">—Shakspere.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The form <i>’em</i> (as in “Tell me your counsels; I will not disclose <i>’em</i>,” in
<i>Julius Cæsar</i>) is not a contraction of <i>them</i>, but of <i>hem</i>, an old objective
plural of <i>he</i>.</p>
</div>

<h5>CASE OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS</h5>

<h6>Nominative Case</h6>

<p id="s-119"><b>119.</b> <b>Nominative constructions</b> of the personal pronouns are the
same as those of nouns (<a href="#s-88">§&nbsp;88</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>I</i> am ready. [Subject.]</li>
  <li>It is <i>I</i>. [Predicate nominative.]</li>
  <li>Here, <i>you</i> rascal, what are you about? [Vocative, direct address.]</li>
  <li>Poor <i>you</i>! [Nominative of exclamation.]</li>
  <li>General Austin, <i>he</i> and no other, won the battle. [Apposition.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">For the <b>nominative absolute</b>, see <a href="#s-345">§&nbsp;345</a>.</p>

<p><a id="page-58" href="#page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
Care must be taken not to use an objective form when a
predicate nominative is required.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>It is <i>I</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>me</i>].</li>
  <li>It is <i>we</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>us</i>] who did it.</li>
  <li>It was <i>he</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>him</i>] who told us.</li>
  <li>It was <i>they</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>them</i>] who were to blame.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-120"><b>120.</b> <i>It</i> has several peculiar uses in the nominative.</p>

<p id="s-120-1">1. <i>It</i> is used as the subject in many expressions like “It
rains,” “It snows,” “It lightens,” “It is cold,” where no
definite subject is thought of. In this use, <i>it</i> is said to be
<b>impersonal</b>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> An impersonal <i>it</i> also occurs as a cognate object (<a href="#s-108">§&nbsp;108</a>) in colloquial
language: as,—“Hang it!” “Go it!” “He went it.” “He farmed it for a
year.” Other examples of the indefinite and impersonal <i>it</i> in various constructions
are: “We are roughing <i>it</i>.” “Keep <i>it</i> up.” “You’ll catch <i>it</i>.” “Let
<i>it</i> all go.” “He made a poor job of <i>it</i>.” “He made a success of <i>it</i>.”</p>

<p id="s-120-2">2. <i>It</i> often serves as grammatical subject merely to introduce
the verb <i>is</i>, the real subject of the thought standing in the
predicate. In this use <i>it</i> is called an <b>expletive</b> (or “filler”).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>It</i> is he.</li>
  <li><i>It</i> is Christmas.</li>
  <li><i>It</i> was a tiresome ride.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these examples, the subject of the thought (<i>he</i>, <i>Christmas</i>,
<i>ride</i>) appears as a predicate nominative.</p>

<p id="s-120-3">3. The antecedent of <i>it</i> is often a group of words.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Wearing tight shoes is foolish. <i>It</i> deforms the feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-121"><b>121.</b> In <b>imperative sentences</b> the subject (<i>you</i>) is commonly
omitted: as,—“Shut the door.”</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The subject <i>I</i> is sometimes omitted in wishes (as, “<i>Would</i> he were
here!” for “I would that he were here”). So also in “Thank you,” “Pray
tell me” (compare <i>prithee</i> for “I pray thee”).</p>

<p>Expressions like “Canst tell?” (for “Canst thou tell?”), “Art there?”
(for “Art thou there?”) are common in poetry and older English. These come
from the gradual wearing away and final disappearance of the pronoun <i>thou</i>
(<i>canst thou</i>, <i>canstow</i>, <i>canstë</i>, <i>canst</i>).</p>

<h6>Possessive Case</h6>

<p id="s-122"><b>122.</b> The <b>possessive</b> forms <i>my</i>, <i>thy</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>your</i>, <i>her</i>, and <i>their</i>
are used when a noun follows; <i>mine</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>ours</i>, <i>yours</i>, <i>hers</i>,
and <i>theirs</i> cannot be followed by a noun, and stand commonly
in the predicate. <i>His</i> may be used in either way.</p>

<p>Examples of <i>mine</i>, <i>yours</i>, etc. not in the predicate are:</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Mine</i> was a terrier; <i>yours</i> was a pointer.</li>
  <li><i>Theirs</i> is a red motor car.</li>
  <li><i>Ours</i> broke down last night.</li>
  <li><i>His</i> leaked badly.</li>
  <li><i>His</i> name is Martin; <i>hers</i> is Smith.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">In such cases the pronoun is always emphatic. The construction is chiefly
colloquial.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English and in poetry <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i> are common instead
of <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i> before words beginning with a vowel or <i>h</i>: as,—</p>

  <li>The very minute bids thee ope <i>thine</i> ear.<span class="attribution">—Shakspere.</span></li>

<p>For expressions like “a friend of <i>mine</i>,” “that unruly tongue of <i>yours</i>,”
see <a href="#s-96">§&nbsp;96</a>.</p>
</div>

<p id="s-123"><b>123.</b> When two or more separate objects are spoken of as

<h6>Objective Case</h6>

<p id="s-124"><b>124.</b> The commonest constructions in which personal pronouns

<h4>THE <i>SELF</i>-PRONOUNS (COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS)</h4>

<p id="s-125"><b>125.</b> The three <b>compound personal pronouns</b> are made by adding
the word <i>self</i> to certain forms of the personal pronouns. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>myself, <i>plural</i> ourselves;</li>
  <li>thyself <i>or</i> yourself, <i>plural</i> yourselves;</li>
  <li>himself, herself, itself, <i>plural</i> themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">To these may be added the indefinite <i>oneself</i>, more commonly written as
two words, <i>one’s self</i> (<a href="#s-139">§&nbsp;139</a>).</p>

<p>Observe that <i>yourself</i> is singular, and <i>yourselves</i> plural.
<i>Hisself</i> and <i>theirselves</i> are incorrect forms. <i>Ourself</i> (not <i>ourselves</i>)
is the compound pronoun corresponding to the royal <i>we</i>
(<a href="#s-118">§&nbsp;118</a>).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>What touches us <i>ourself</i> shall be last served.<span class="attribution">—Shakspere.</span></p>

<b>126.</b> 1. <b>The compound personal pronouns may be used to emphasize
substantives.</b></p>

<p><b>In this use they are called intensive pronouns.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>myself</i> will go.</li>
  <li>King Alfred <i>himself</i> took the field.</li>
  <li>They did the work <i>themselves</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>An intensive pronoun is in apposition with the substantive
to which it refers.</p>

<p>2. <b>The compound personal pronouns may be used as the objects of
transitive verbs or of prepositions when the object denotes the same
person or thing as the subject.</b></p>

<p><b>In this use they are called reflexive pronouns.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I have hurt <i>myself</i>.</li>
  <li>King Alfred interested <i>himself</i> in his subjects.</li>
  <li>These schemers deceived <i>themselves</i>.</li>
  <li>Mary was talking to <i>herself</i>.</li>
  <li>He gave <i>himself</i> a holiday. [Indirect object.]</li>
</ul>

<p>These pronouns are called <b>reflexive</b> (that is, “bending back”)
because they <b>refer back</b> to the subject and repeat its meaning in
an object construction.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> A reflexive pronoun sometimes refers to a substantive in the objective
case: as,—“Our captors left <i>us</i> to <i>ourselves</i>.”</p>

<p>In older English the simple personal pronouns <i>me</i>, <i>thee</i>, etc., were often
used reflexively: as,—“I held <i>me</i> [= <i>myself</i>] still”; “Yield <i>thee</i> [= <i>thyself</i>]
captive”; “They built <i>them</i> [= for <i>themselves</i>] houses” (see <a href="#s-106">§&nbsp;106</a>). This idiom
survives in colloquial language (as, “I have hurt <i>me</i>,” “I have bought <i>me</i> a
rifle”), but it is avoided in writing except in a few expressions such as: “I
must look about <i>me</i>”; “We gazed about <i>us</i>”; “Look behind <i>you</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p id="s-127"><b>127.</b> The adjective <i>own</i> is sometimes inserted between the
first and the second part of the <i>self</i>-pronouns for emphasis.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>my own self,</li>
    <li>your own self,</li>
    <li>his own self,</li>
    <li>our own selves,</li>
    <li>their own selves.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note">In this use, <i>self</i> is in strictness a noun limited by the possessive and by the
adjective <i>own</i>, but the phrases may be regarded as compound pronouns. Other
adjectives are sometimes inserted between the possessive and <i>self</i>: as,—my
<i>very</i> self, his <i>worthless</i> self.</p>

<p id="s-128"><a id="page-62" href="#page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
<b>128.</b> The intensive pronouns are sometimes used without a
substantive. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>It is <i>myself</i>. [<i>Myself</i> = <i>I myself</i>.]</li>
  <li>You are hardly <i>yourself</i> to-day.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">In poetry and older English, the intensives are even found as subjects:
as,—“<i>Ourself</i> will mingle with society” (<i>Macbeth</i>).</p>

<p id="s-129"><b>129.</b> The intensive pronouns should not be used as simple
personal pronouns.</p>

<p class="note">Thus we should say:—“He was kind to Mary and <i>me</i>” (<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>myself</i>);
“They invited my wife and <i>me</i> (<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>myself</i>).”</p>

<h4>ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS</h4>

<p id="s-130"><b>130.</b> <b>Some words are used either as adjectives or as pronouns. Such
words are called adjective pronouns.</b></p>

<h5>I. DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS</h5>

<p id="s-131"><b>131.</b> <b>The demonstratives are <i>this</i> (plural, <i>these</i>), <i>that</i> (plural, <i>those</i>).

pronouns.</p>

<p class="note">If the demonstrative is followed by a noun which it limits (as in
“<i>this</i> sailor”), it is an adjective. If the demonstrative points out something
which it does not name (as in “<i>This</i> is a fine morning”), it takes
the place of a noun and is therefore a pronoun. The simple subject of
the sentence “This camera is expensive” is the noun <i>camera</i>, which is
modified by the adjective <i>this</i>. The subject of the sentence “<i>This</i> is
expensive” is the pronoun <i>this</i>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Yon</i>, <i>yond</i>, and <i>yonder</i> are common as demonstratives in older English
and in poetry. Thus,—“Nerissa, cheer <i>yon</i> stranger” (<i>Merchant of
Venice</i>). “Question <i>yond</i> man” (<i>As You Like It</i>). “Is not <i>yond</i> Diomed?”
(<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>). “Call <i>yonder</i> fellow hither” (<i>Henry V</i>). “Is <i>yonder</i>
the man?” (<i>As You Like It</i>).</p>

<p id="s-132"><b>132.</b> Demonstratives have only the inflection of number.
They have the same form for all three genders. The nominative
and objective cases are alike; the possessive is replaced
by <i>of</i> with the objective.</p>

<h5>II. INDEFINITE PRONOUNS</h5>

<p id="s-135"><b>135.</b> <b>The indefinite pronouns point out objects less clearly or definitely

<p id="s-136"><b>136.</b> Most indefinites may be either <b>pronouns</b> or <b>adjectives</b>.
But <i>none</i> is always a substantive in modern use, and <i>every</i> is
always an adjective.</p>

<p id="s-137"><b>137.</b> <i>None</i> may be either singular or plural. When it means
distinctly <i>not one</i>, it is singular. In many instances either construction
is permissible.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>None</i> of us has the key.</li>
  <li><i>None</i> was (<i>or</i> were) left to tell the tale.</li>

  <li>We must bear with <i>one another</i>.</li>

<i>aught</i>, <i>naught</i>,<a href="#footnote-20" id="marker-20" class="marker" title="Footnote 20"><sup>20</sup></a> etc., are called indefinite nouns.</p>

<p id="s-141"><b>141.</b> Care should be taken in framing such sentences as the
following:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Everybody has <i>his</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>their</i>] faults.</li>
  <li>If anybody wishes to go, <i>he</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>they</i>] may.</li>

  <li>Each of us must lead <i>his</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>their</i>] own life.</li>
</ul>

<p>In sentences of this kind, the personal pronoun (<i>he</i>, <i>his</i>,
<i>him</i>) must be in the singular to agree with its antecedent
(<i>everybody</i>, <i>anybody</i>, etc.) (see <a href="#s-113">§&nbsp;113</a>).</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> When the antecedent is of common gender (as in the last example),
the personal pronouns (<i>he</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>him</i>) may be regarded as of common gender
also. In very precise or formal language, one may say <i>he or she</i>, <i>his or her</i>:
as,—“Each of us must lead <i>his or her</i> own life”; but this form of expression
is to be avoided unless the distinction is clearly necessary.</p>

<p id="s-142"><b>142.</b> When used as adjectives, none of the indefinites have
any forms of inflection. The same is true when they are pronouns,
except as follows:—</p>

<p class="note"><i>Others</i> is used as the plural of <i>another</i>. The possessive forms are:—singular,
<i>another’s</i>; plural, <i>others’</i>. <i>The other</i> (possessive, <i>the other’s</i>) has
in the plural <i>the others</i> (possessive, <i>the others’</i>). <i>Each other</i> and <i>one another</i>
add <i>’s</i> in the possessive. <i>One</i> has a possessive <i>one’s</i>; <i>the one</i> becomes <i>the
ones</i> in the plural.</p>
<a id="page-66" href="#page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>

<h4>RELATIVE PRONOUNS</h4>

<p id="s-143"><b>143.</b> <b>Relative pronouns</b> have a peculiar function in the sentence,
since they serve both as <b>pronouns</b> and as <b>connectives</b>. Their
use may be seen by comparing the two sentences that follow:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. This is the sailor, and he saved my life.</li>
  <li>2. This is the sailor who saved my life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each consists of two parts or clauses (<a href="#s-44">§&nbsp;44</a>). In No. 1, the two
clauses are connected by the conjunction <i>and</i>, which belongs
to neither; the pronoun <i>he</i>, which stands for <i>sailor</i>, is the subject
of the second clause. In No. 2, there is no conjunction;
instead, we find the word <i>who</i>, which replaces <i>and he</i>. This
<i>who</i> is a <b>pronoun</b>, since it stands for <i>sailor</i> (precisely as <i>he</i> does
in No. 1) and (like <i>he</i>) is the subject of the verb <i>saved</i>. But
<i>who</i> is also a <b>connective</b>, since it joins the two parts of the sentence
as <i>and</i> does in No. 1. Such words (which serve both as
pronouns and as connectives) are called <b>relative pronouns</b>.</p>

<p>In No. 1, the two clauses are <b>coördinate</b>. Neither serves as a
modifier, and each might stand alone as a complete sentence
(“This is the sailor.” “He saved my life”). The sentence is
compound (<a href="#s-44">§&nbsp;44</a>). In No. 2, on the contrary, the clause <i>who
saved my life</i> is a <b>subordinate</b> or <b>dependent clause</b>, for it is used
as an adjective modifier of the noun <i>sailor</i>, which it limits by
showing what particular sailor is meant. The sentence is <b>complex</b>
(<a href="#s-44">§&nbsp;44</a>). The dependent clause (<i>who saved my life</i>) is connected
with the main clause (<i>this is the sailor</i>) by the pronoun <i>who</i>,
which refers to <i>sailor</i>.</p>

<p id="s-144"><b>144.</b> <b>Relative pronouns connect dependent clauses with main clauses
by referring directly to a substantive in the main clause.</b><a href="#footnote-21" id="marker-21" class="marker" title="Footnote 21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p><b>This substantive is the antecedent of the relative</b> (<a href="#s-11">§&nbsp;11</a>).</p>

<p>Thus in <a href="#s-143">§&nbsp;143</a> the noun <i>sailor</i> is the antecedent of <i>who</i>.</p>

<p class="note"><i>Relative</i> means “carrying back.” These pronouns are so called because
they carry the mind back directly to the antecedent.</p>

<p id="s-145"><a id="page-67" href="#page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
<b>145.</b> The simple relative pronouns are <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>as</i>,

person of the <b>antecedent</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>It is <i>I who am</i> wrong. [First person, singular number: antecedent, <i>I</i>.]</li>

  <li>All <i>you who are</i> ready may go. [Second person plural: antecedent,
  <i>you</i>.]</li>

  <li>Give help to <i>him who needs it</i>. [Third person, singular: antecedent,
  <i>him</i>.]</li>

  <li>The <i>road that leads</i> to the shore is sandy. [Third person singular:
  antecedent, <i>road</i>.]</li>

  <li>The <i>roads that lead</i> to the shore are sandy. [Third person plural:
  antecedent, <i>roads</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p>To determine the number and person of a relative pronoun
is particularly necessary when it is the <b>subject of the clause</b>, for
the form of the verb varies (as the examples show) according
to the number and person of the subject (<a href="#s-222">§&nbsp;222</a>). Hence the
rule for the agreement of a relative with its antecedent is of
much practical importance.</p>

<p id="s-150"><b>150.</b> <b>The case of a relative pronoun has nothing to do with its antecedent,
but depends on the construction of its own clause.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The servant <i>who</i> opened the door wore livery. [<i>Who</i> is in the nominative
  case, being the subject of <i>opened</i>.]</li>

  <li>He discharged his servant, <i>who</i> immediately left town. [<i>Who</i> is in
  the nominative case, since it is the subject of <i>left</i>, although its antecedent
  (<i>servant</i>) is in the objective.]</li>

  <li>The servant <i>whom</i> you discharged has returned. [<i>Whom</i> is in the
  objective case, since it is the direct object of <i>discharged</i>. The antecedent

  of <i>has returned</i>.]</li>

  <li>Here is such money <i>as</i> I have. [<i>As</i> is in the objective case, being the

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English a relative in the nominative is often omitted: as,—“There’s
two or three of us <i>have</i> seen strange sights” (<i>Julius Cæsar</i>),
that is, “There are two or three of us <i>who have</i> seen,” etc. The same omission
is often made in rapid or careless colloquial speech. It is approved in clauses
with <i>there</i> in such sentences as “He is one of the best men there are in the
world” (<a href="#s-232">§&nbsp;232</a>).</p>

<p id="s-152"><b>152.</b> Certain questions of <b>gender</b> call for particular attention.</p>

<p>1. <i>Which</i> is commonly used in referring to the lower animals
unless these are regarded as persons. This is true even when
<i>he</i> or <i>she</i> is used of the same animals (<a href="#s-69">§&nbsp;69</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>This is the dog <i>which</i> I mentioned. Isn’t <i>he</i> a fine fellow?</li>
  <li>We have one cow <i>which</i> we prize highly. <i>She</i> is a Jersey.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. The possessive <i>whose</i> may be used of any object that
has life.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>This is the man <i>whose</i> watch was stolen.</li>
  <li>I have a cat <i>whose</i> name is Tabby.</li>
  <li>This is the tree <i>whose</i> leaves were destroyed. <i>It</i> is quite dead.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. In the case of things without animal life, <i>of which</i> and
<i>whose</i> are both common. The tendency is to prefer <i>of which</i>
in prose, but <i>whose</i> is often used because of its more agreeable
sound. In poetry, <i>whose</i> is especially frequent.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>A broad river, the name <i>of which</i> I have forgotten, forms the northern
  boundary of the province.</li>

  <li>Jack was fishing with a bamboo rod, to the end <i>of which</i> he had tied a
  short piece of ordinary twine.</li>

  <li>She was gazing into the pool, <i>whose</i> calm surface reflected her features
  like a mirror. [“The surface <i>of which</i>” would not sound so well.]</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English, <i>which</i> is often used for <i>who</i> or <i>whom</i>: as,—“He
<i>which</i> hath your noble father slain, pursued my life” (<i>Hamlet</i>).</p>

<p>The compounds <i>whereof</i>, <i>wherefrom</i>, <i>wherewith</i>, etc., are equivalent to <i>of
which</i>, <i>from which</i>, etc. (cf. <a href="#s-124">§&nbsp;124</a>). Thus,—“Esau hated Jacob because of the
blessing <i>wherewith</i> his father blessed him” (<i>Genesis</i> xxvii. 41).</p>

<h5>DESCRIPTIVE AND RESTRICTIVE RELATIVES</h5>

<p id="s-153"><b>153.</b> The clause introduced by a relative pronoun is an
<b>adjective clause</b>, since it serves as an adjective modifier of the
antecedent (<a href="#s-143">§&nbsp;143</a>). There are two different ways in which the
antecedent may be thus modified.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. The Italian, <i>who wore a flower in his coat</i>, smiled at me.</li>
  <li>2. The Italian <i>who wore a flower in his coat</i> smiled at me.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the italicized relative clause serves
simply to <b>describe</b> the Italian, not to identify him. The flower
is a mere detail of the picture.</p>

<p>In the second sentence, the relative clause serves not merely
to describe the Italian, but also to distinguish him from all
others. The flower is mentioned as a means of <b>identification</b>.
The relative clause confines or <b>restricts</b> the meaning of the
antecedent (<i>Italian</i>).</p>

<p id="s-154"><b>154.</b> <b>A relative pronoun that serves merely to introduce a descriptive
fact is called a descriptive relative.</b></p>

<p><b>A relative pronoun that introduces a clause confining or limiting the
application of the antecedent is called a restrictive relative.</b></p>

<p>Thus in the first example in <a href="#s-153">§&nbsp;153</a>, <i>who</i> is a descriptive
relative; in the second, it is a restrictive relative.</p>

<p id="s-155"><b>155.</b> Before a descriptive relative we regularly make a pause
in speaking, but never before a restrictive relative. Hence
the rule:—</p>

<p><b>A descriptive relative is preceded by a comma; a restrictive relative
is not.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Three sailors, <i>who</i> were loitering on the pier, sprang to the rescue.</li>

  <li>A clumsy weapon, <i>which</i> I took for a blunderbuss, hung over the
  fireplace.</li>

  <li>I told the news to the first man <i>that</i> (or <i>whom</i>) I met.</li>

  <li>The coins <i>that</i> (or <i>which</i>) you showed me are doubloons.</li>

  <li>Nothing <i>that</i> I have ever read has moved me more profoundly than
  the third act of “King Lear.”</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-156"><a id="page-71" href="#page-71" class="pagenum" title="71"></a>
<b>156.</b> <i>Who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>that</i> are all used as restrictive relatives;
but some writers prefer <i>that</i> to <i>which</i>, especially in the
nominative case.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>That</i> is not now employed as a descriptive relative, though it was
common in this use not very long ago. Thus in 1844 Disraeli wrote: “The deer,
<i>that</i> abounded, lived here in a world as savage as themselves” (<i>Coningsby</i>,
book iii, chapter 5).</p>

<p>The omission of the relative (<a href="#s-151">§&nbsp;151</a>) is possible only when the relative is
restrictive.</p>
</div>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The boy [<i>whom</i>] I saw at your house has left town. [Restrictive.]</li>
  <li>Charles, <i>whom</i> I saw yesterday, had not heard the news. [Descriptive.]</li>
</ul>

<h5>THE RELATIVE PRONOUN <i>WHAT</i></h5>

<p id="s-157"><b>157.</b> The relative pronoun <i>what</i> is equivalent to <i>that which</i>,
and has a <b>double construction</b>:—(1) the construction of the
<b>omitted</b> or <b>implied antecedent</b> (<i>that</i>); (2) the construction of the
<b>relative</b> (<i>which</i>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{<i>What</i> | <i>That which</i>} was said is true.
  [Here <i>what</i>, being equivalent to <i>that
  which</i>, serves as the subject both of <i>was said</i> and of <i>is</i>.]</li>
  <li>Tom always remembers {<i>what</i> | <i>that which</i>} is said to him.
  [Here <i>what</i>, being equivalent to <i>that which</i>, serves as both the object of
  <i>remembers</i> and as the subject of <i>is said</i>.]</li>
  <li>Tom always remembers {<i>what</i> | <i>that which</i>}
  he learns. [Here <i>what</i> serves both as the object of <i>remembers</i> and as the object of <i>learns</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p>In parsing <i>what</i>, mention both of its constructions.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Another method of dealing with the relative <i>what</i> is to regard the
whole clause (<i>what was said</i>; <i>what is said to him</i>; <i>what he learns</i>) as a <b>noun
clause</b>. Thus the clause <i>what was said</i> in the first sentence would be the subject
of <i>is</i>; in the second and third sentences, the clause would be the object of
<i>remembers</i>. <i>What</i>, in the first sentence, would be parsed as the subject of <i>was
said</i>; in the second, as the subject of <i>is said</i>; and in the third, as the object
of <i>learns</i>. Neither view is incorrect, and each has its special advantages. The
student may well be familiar with both methods, remembering that grammar
cannot be treated like mathematics.</p>

<h5>COMPOUND RELATIVE PRONOUNS</h5>

<p id="s-158"><b>158.</b> <b>The compound relative pronouns are formed by adding <i>ever</i> or
<i>soever</i> to <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>what</i>.</b></p>

<p>They are declined as follows:—</p>

<table class="type-2 left" summary="">
  <caption>Singular and Plural</caption>
  <tr>
    <th><i>Nominative</i></th>
    <td>whoever  (whosoever)</td>
    <td>whichever (whichsoever)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><i>Possessive</i></th>
    <td>whosever (whosesoever)</td>
    <td class="center">————</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><i>Objective</i></th>
    <td>whomever (whomsoever)</td>
    <td>whichever (whichsoever)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><i>Whatever</i> (<i>whatsoever</i>) has no inflection. The nominative
and the objective are alike, and the possessive is supplied by
the phrase <i>of whatever</i> (<i>of whatsoever</i>).</p>

<p>The phrase <i>of whichever</i> (<i>of whichsoever</i>) is used instead of
<i>whosever</i> exactly as <i>of which</i> is used instead of <i>whose</i> (<a href="#s-152">§&nbsp;152</a>).</p>

<p id="s-159"><b>159.</b> <b>The compound relative pronouns may include or imply their
own antecedents and hence may have a double construction.</b></p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>Whoever</i> calls, <i>he</i> must be admitted. [Here <i>he</i>, the antecedent of <i>whoever</i>,
is the subject of <i>must be admitted</i>, and <i>whoever</i> is the subject of <i>calls</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Whoever calls</i> must be admitted. [Here the antecedent <i>he</i> is omitted,
being implied in <i>whoever</i>. <i>Whoever</i> has therefore a double construction,
being the subject of both <i>calls</i> and <i>must be admitted</i>.]</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He shall have <i>whatever</i> he wishes.</li>
  <li>I will do <i>whichever</i> you say.</li>
</ul>

<p>In such sentences, care should be taken to use <i>whoever</i> and
<i>whomever</i> correctly. The nominative (<i>whoever</i>) is required
when the relative is the subject of its own clause.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He asked <i>whoever</i> came.</li>
  <li>He told the story to <i>whoever</i> would listen.</li>
  <li>He asked <i>whomever</i> he knew.</li>
  <li>He told the story to <i>whomever</i> he met.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-160"><b>160.</b> The compound relatives are sometimes used without an
antecedent expressed or implied.</p>
<a id="page-73" href="#page-73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Whoever</i> deserts you, I will remain faithful.</li>
  <li><i>Whomever</i> it offends, I will speak the truth.</li>
  <li><i>Whatever</i> he attempts, he is sure to fail.</li>
  <li><i>Whichever</i> you choose, you will be disappointed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This construction is closely related to that explained in <a href="#s-159">§&nbsp;159</a>.
“Whoever deserts you, I will remain faithful,” is practically equivalent to
“Whoever deserts you, let him desert you! I will remain faithful.” No
antecedent, however, is felt by the speaker, and hence none need be supplied
in parsing. Compare concessive clauses (<a href="#s-401">§&nbsp;401</a>).</p>

<p id="s-161"><b>161.</b> <i>Which</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>whichever</i>, and <i>whatever</i> are often used
as adjectives.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Use <i>what</i> (or <i>whatever</i>) powers you have.</li>
  <li><i>Whichever</i> plan you adopt, you have my best wishes.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-162"><b>162.</b> A noun limited by the adjectives <i>what</i>, <i>whichever</i>, and
<i>whatever</i>, may have the same double construction that these
relatives have when they are used as pronouns (<a href="#s-159">§&nbsp;159</a>). Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Take <i>whichever</i> pen is not in use. [Here <i>pen</i> is both the direct object
of <i>take</i>, and the subject of <i>is</i>.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>Whoso</i> for <i>whosoever</i> and <i>whatso</i> for <i>whatsoever</i> are common in older
English.</p>

<h4>INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS</h4>

<p id="s-163"><b>163.</b> <b>The interrogative pronouns are <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>what</i>. They are
used in asking questions.</b><a href="#footnote-22" id="marker-22" class="marker" title="Footnote 22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Who</i> is your neighbor?</li>
  <li><i>Who</i> goes there?</li>
  <li><i>Whom</i> have you chosen?</li>
  <li>From <i>whom</i> did you learn this?</li>
  <li><i>Whose</i> voice is that?</li>
  <li><i>Which</i> shall I take?</li>
  <li><i>Which</i> is correct?</li>
  <li><i>What</i> did he say?</li>
  <li><i>What</i> is lacking?</li>
  <li>With <i>what</i> are you so delighted?</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-164"><b>164.</b> <i>Who</i> has a possessive <i>whose</i>, and an objective <i>whom</i>.
<i>Which</i> and <i>what</i> are not inflected.</p>

<p><i>Who</i> may be either masculine or feminine; <i>which</i> and <i>what</i>
may be of any gender.</p>

<p id="s-165"><a id="page-74" href="#page-74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a>
<b>165.</b> The <b>objective</b> <i>whom</i> often begins a question (as in the
third example in <a href="#s-163">§&nbsp;163</a>). Care should be taken not to write <i>who</i>
for <i>whom</i>.</p>

<p id="s-166"><b>166.</b> <i>Which</i> and <i>what</i> are used as <b>interrogative adjectives</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Which</i> street shall I take?</li>
  <li><i>What</i> village is this?</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-167"><b>167.</b> The interrogative adjective <i>what</i> may be used in a
peculiar form of exclamatory sentence. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>What</i> a cold night this is!</li>
  <li><i>What</i> courage he must have had!</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><i>What!</i> by itself often serves as an exclamation: as,—“<i>What!</i> do you
really think so?” In this use <i>what</i> may be regarded as an interjection.</p>

<p id="s-168"><b>168.</b> In <b>parsing pronouns</b> the following models may be used:—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>1. <i>He</i> was my earliest friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>He</i> is a personal pronoun of the third person. It is in the masculine
gender, the singular number, and the nominative case, being the subject
of the verb <i>was</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>2. A policeman <i>whom</i> I met showed me the house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>Whom</i> is a relative pronoun of the masculine gender, singular number,
and third person, agreeing with its antecedent, <i>policeman</i>. It is in the
objective case, being the direct object of the transitive verb <i>met</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>3. The corporal, <i>whose</i> name was Scott, came from Leith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>Whose</i> is a relative pronoun of the masculine gender, singular number,
and third person, agreeing with its antecedent, <i>corporal</i>. It is in the
possessive case, modifying the noun <i>name</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>4. <i>Whose</i> birthday do we celebrate in February?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>Whose</i> is an interrogative pronoun in the masculine or feminine gender,
singular number, and possessive case, modifying the noun <i>birthday</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>5. He injured <i>himself</i> severely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><i>Himself</i> is a compound personal pronoun of the third person, used reflexively.
It is of the masculine gender, singular number, and third person,
agreeing with its antecedent, <i>he</i>. It is in the objective case, being
the direct object of the transitive verb <i>injured</i>.</p>

<span class="subtitle">ADJECTIVES</span></h3>

<h4>CLASSIFICATION OF ADJECTIVES</h4>

<p id="s-169"><b>169.</b> <b>An adjective is a word which describes or limits a substantive.</b></p>

<p><b>An adjective is said to belong to the substantive which it describes
or limits.</b></p>

<p><b>An adjective which describes is called a descriptive adjective; one
which points out or designates is called a definitive adjective</b> (<a href="#s-13">§&nbsp;13</a>).</p>

<p>Most adjectives are descriptive: as,—<i>round</i>, <i>cold</i>, <i>red</i>, <i>angry</i>,
<i>graceful</i>, <i>excessive</i>, <i>young</i>, <i>sudden</i>, <i>Roman</i>.</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> Many descriptive adjectives are <b>compound</b> (see <a href="#s-64">§&nbsp;64</a>): as,—steadfast,
lionlike, fireproof, downright, heartsick, everlasting, brown-eyed, broad-shouldered,
ill-tempered, dear-bought, far-fetched, never-ending, self-evident,
self-important. “He was a <i>matter-of-fact</i> person.” “Tom is <i>hail-fellow-well-met</i>
with everybody.” “This is an <i>out-of-the-way</i> place.” “A dashing, <i>down-at-the-heel</i>
youth answered my knock.”</p>

<p id="s-170"><b>170.</b> A proper noun used as an adjective, or an adjective
derived from a proper noun, is called a <b>proper adjective</b> and
usually begins with a capital letter.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>a <i>Panama</i> hat,</li>
    <li><i>Florida</i> oranges,</li>
    <li>a <i>Bunsen</i> burner;</li>
    <li>Virginian,</li>
    <li>Spenserian,</li>
    <li>Newtonian,</li>
    <li>Icelandic,</li>
    <li>Miltonic,</li>
    <li>Byronic,</li>
    <li>Turkish,</li>
    <li>English,</li>
    <li>Veronese.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Many so-called proper adjectives begin with a small letter because
their origin is forgotten or disregarded: as,—<i>china</i> dishes, <i>italic</i> type, <i>mesmeric</i>
power, a <i>jovial</i> air, a <i>saturnine</i> expression, a <i>mercurial</i> temperament,
a <i>stentorian</i> voice.</p>

<p id="s-171"><b>171.</b> <b>Definitive adjectives</b> include:—pronouns used as adjectives
(as, <i>this</i> opportunity; <i>those</i> pictures; <i>either</i> table; <i>what</i>
time is it?); numeral adjectives (as, <i>two</i> stars; the <i>third</i> year);
the <b>articles</b>, <i>a</i> (or <i>an</i>) and <i>the</i>.</p>

<p><a id="page-76" href="#page-76" class="pagenum" title="76"></a>
Pronouns used as adjectives (often called pronominal adjectives)
have been studied under Pronouns—demonstratives
(<a href="#s-131">§§&nbsp;131–134</a>), indefinites (<a href="#s-135">§§&nbsp;135–142</a>), relatives (<a href="#s-143">§§&nbsp;143–162</a>),
interrogatives (<a href="#s-163">§§&nbsp;163–167</a>).</p>

<p>Numeral adjectives will be treated, along with other numerals
(nouns and adverbs), in <a href="#s-204">§§&nbsp;204–208</a>.</p>

<p>The articles will be treated in <a href="#s-173">§§&nbsp;173–180</a>.</p>

<p id="s-172"><b>172.</b> Adjectives may be classified, according to their position
in the sentence, as <b>attributive</b>, <b>appositive</b>, and <b>predicate adjectives</b>.</p>

<p id="s-172-1">1. An <b>attributive adjective</b> is closely attached to its noun and
regularly precedes it.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The <i>angry</i> spot doth glow on Cæsar’s brow.</li>
  <li>O you <i>hard</i> hearts, you <i>cruel</i> men of Rome!</li>
  <li><i>Yond</i> Cassius has a <i>lean</i> and <i>hungry</i> look.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-172-2">2. An <b>appositive adjective</b> is added to its noun to explain it,
like a noun in apposition (<a href="#s-88-5">§&nbsp;88, 5</a>).</p>

<table class="type-1" summary="">
  <tr>
    <th>Noun in Apposition</th>
    <th>Appositive Adjective</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Bertram, the <i>ringleader</i>, refused to surrender.</td>
    <td>Bertram, <i>undaunted</i>, refused to surrender.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p id="s-172-3">3. A <b>predicate adjective</b> completes the meaning of the predicate
verb, but describes or limits the subject.</p>

<p>Predicate adjectives are common after <i>is</i> (in its various forms)
and other copulative verbs, particularly <i>become</i> and <i>seem</i> (<a href="#s-17">§&nbsp;17</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The sea is <i>rough</i> to-day.</li>
  <li>Burton soon became <i>cautious</i> in his judgments.</li>
  <li>You seem <i>anxious</i> about your future.</li>
  <li>The air grew <i>hot</i> and <i>sultry</i>.</li>
  <li>Our first experiment proved <i>unsuccessful</i>.</li>
  <li>The milk turned <i>sour</i>.</li>
  <li>Our agent proved <i>trustworthy</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The construction of the predicate adjective is similar to that of the
predicate nominative (<a href="#s-88-2">§&nbsp;88, 2</a>). Both are known as <b>complements</b>, because they
complete the meaning of a verb.</p>

<p><a id="page-77" href="#page-77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a>
After <i>look</i>, <i>sound</i>, <i>taste</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>feel</i>, a predicate adjective is

<h4>THE ARTICLES</h4>

<p id="s-173"><b>173.</b> <b>The adjectives <i>a</i> (or <i>an</i>) and <i>the</i> are called articles.</b></p>

<p id="s-173-1">1. <b>The definite article <i>the</i> points out one or more particular objects as
distinct from others of the same kind.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>The</i> train is late.</li>
  <li>Here is <i>the</i> key.</li>
  <li><i>The</i> children are in <i>the</i> next room.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-173-2">2. <b>The indefinite article <i>a</i> (or <i>an</i>) designates an object as merely one
of a general class or kind.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Lend me <i>a</i> pencil.</li>
  <li>I have <i>a</i> cold.</li>
  <li><i>A</i> young man answered my knock.</li>
</ul>

<p>The article <i>a</i> is a fragment of <i>ān</i> (pronounced <i>ahn</i>), the
ancient form of the numeral <i>one</i>; <i>an</i> keeps the <i>n</i>, which <i>a</i>
has lost. <i>The</i> is an old demonstrative, related to <i>that</i>.</p>

<p id="s-174"><b>174.</b> <i>The</i> with a singular noun sometimes indicates a <b>class</b>
or <b>kind</b> of objects.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>The scholar</i> is not necessarily a dryasdust.</li>
  <li><i>The elephant</i> is the largest of quadrupeds.</li>
  <li><i>The aëroplane</i> is a very recent invention.</li>
  <li>Resin is obtained from <i>the pine</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> In this use <i>the</i> is often called the <b>generic article</b> (from the Latin
<i>genus</i>, “kind” or “sort”). The singular number with the generic <i>the</i> is practically
equivalent to the plural without an article. Thus in the first example
the sense would be the same if we had, “<i>Scholars</i> are not necessarily dryasdusts.”</p>

<p id="s-175"><a id="page-78" href="#page-78" class="pagenum" title="78"></a>
<b>175.</b> An adjective preceded by <i>the</i> may be used as a plural
noun.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>The brave</i> are honored.</li>
  <li><i>The rich</i> have many cares.</li>
  <li><i>The strong</i> should protect <i>the weak</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-176"><b>176.</b> <b><i>An</i> is used before words beginning with a vowel or silent <i>h</i>;
<i>a</i> before other words.</b> Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example inline">
  <li><i>an</i> owl;</li>
  <li><i>an</i> apple;</li>
  <li><i>an</i> honest man;</li>
  <li><i>a</i> stone;</li>
  <li><i>a</i> pear.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-177"><b>177.</b> Special rules for <i>a</i> or <i>an</i> are the following:—</p>

<p>1. Before words beginning with the sound of <i>y</i> or <i>w</i>, the
form <i>a</i>, not <i>an</i>, is used.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>a union,</li>
    <li>a university,</li>
    <li>a yew,</li>
    <li>a ewe,</li>
    <li>a eulogy,</li>
    <li>a Utopian</li>
    <li>scheme,</li>
    <li>such a one.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note">
This rule covers all words beginning with <i>eu</i> and many beginning with <i>u</i>.
Note that the initial sound is a consonant, not a vowel. <i>An</i> was formerly
common before such words (as,—<i>an</i> union, such <i>an</i> one), but <i>a</i> is now the
settled form.</p>

<p>2. Before words beginning with <i>h</i> and not accented on the
first syllable, <i>an</i> is often used. Thus, we say—</p>

<ul class="example inline">
  <li><i>a</i> his´tory; </li>
  <li><span class="smaller">BUT</span>, <i>an</i> histor´ical novel.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
In such cases, the <i>h</i> is very weak in sound, and is sometimes quite silent,
so that the word practically begins with a vowel. Usage varies, but careful
writers favor the rule here given. <i>An</i> was formerly more common before <i>h</i>
than at present.</p>

<p id="s-178"><b>178.</b> With two or more connected nouns or adjectives the
article should be repeated whenever clearness requires (cf. <a href="#s-123">§&nbsp;123</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I have consulted <i>the</i> secretary and <i>the</i> treasurer. [“The secretary and
  treasurer” would imply that the same person held both offices.]</li>

  <li>I found <i>an</i> anchor and <i>a</i> chain. [“An anchor and chain” would suggest
  that the chain was attached to the anchor.]</li>

  <li>In some towns there are separate schools for <i>the</i> boys and <i>the</i> girls;
  in others <i>the</i> boys and girls attend the same schools.</li>

  <li>He waved <i>a</i> red and white flag.</li>

  <li>He waved <i>a</i> red and <i>a</i> white flag.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-179"><a id="page-79" href="#page-79" class="pagenum" title="79"></a>
<b>179.</b> <i>A</i> is often used distributively, in the sense of <i>each</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I paid five dollars <i>a</i> pair for my shoes.</li>
  <li>The letter-carrier calls twice <i>a</i> day.</li>
  <li>My class meets three times <i>a</i> week.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
In such phrases <i>a</i> is better than <i>per</i>, except in strictly commercial language.</p>

<p id="s-180"><b>180.</b> When used with adjectives, the articles precede, except
in a few phrases: as,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Such an uproar was never heard.</li>
  <li>Many a man has tried in vain.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p>For the adverb <i>the</i>, which is quite distinct from the article in use and
meaning, see <a href="#s-195">§&nbsp;195</a>.</p>

<p>For the preposition <i>a</i> (as in “He went <i>a</i>-fishing”), see <a href="#s-352">§&nbsp;352</a>.</p>

<h4>COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES</h4>

<p id="s-181"><b>181.</b> In <b>comparing</b> objects with each other, we may use three
different forms of the same adjective.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Thomas is <i>strong</i>.</li>
  <li>William is <i>stronger</i> than Thomas.</li>
  <li>Herbert is <i>strongest</i> of the three.</li>
</ul>

<p>This inflection of adjectives is called <b>comparison</b>, and the
three forms are called <b>degrees of comparison</b>.</p>

<p id="s-182"><b>182.</b> <b>The degrees of comparison indicate by their form in what degree
of intensity the quality described by the adjective exists.</b></p>

<p><b>There are three degrees of comparison,—the positive, the comparative,
and the superlative.</b></p>

<p id="s-182-1">1. <b>The positive degree is the simplest form of the adjective, and has
no special ending.</b></p>

<p>It merely describes the quality, without expressing or suggesting
any comparison.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Thomas is <i>strong</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the positive degree of the adjective <i>strong</i> is <i>strong</i>.</p>

<p id="s-182-2"><a id="page-80" href="#page-80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a>
2. <b>The comparative degree of an adjective is formed by adding the
termination <i>er</i> to the positive degree.</b></p>

<p>It denotes that the quality exists in the object described in
a higher degree than in some other object.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>William is <i>stronger</i> than Thomas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the comparative degree of the adjective <i>strong</i> is <i>stronger</i>.</p>

<p id="s-182-3">3. <b>The superlative degree is formed by adding <i>est</i> to the positive
degree.</b></p>

<p>It denotes that the quality exists in the highest degree in
the object described.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Herbert is <i>strongest</i> of the three.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other examples of the <b>comparison of adjectives</b> are:—</p>

<p id="s-183"><b>183.</b> <span class="smcap">Rules of Spelling.</span></p>

<p id="s-183-1">1. Adjectives ending in silent <i>e</i> drop this letter before the
comparative ending <i>er</i> and the superlative ending <i>est</i>. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example inline">
  <li>wise, wiser, wisest;</li>
  <li>pure, purer, purest;</li>
  <li>handsome, handsomer, handsomest.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-183-2">2. Most adjectives ending in <i>y</i> change <i>y</i> to <i>i</i> before the endings
<i>er</i> and <i>est</i>. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example inline">
  <li>silky, silkier, silkiest;</li>
  <li>glossy, glossier, glossiest;</li>
  <li>sorry, sorrier, sorriest.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-183-3">3. Adjectives having a short vowel and ending in a single
consonant double this before the endings <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example inline">
  <li>dim, dimmer, dimmest;</li>
  <li>sad, sadder, saddest;</li>
  <li>fit, fitter, fittest;</li>
  <li>big, bigger, biggest;</li>

<b>184.</b> <b>Many adjectives are compared by prefixing the adverbs <i>more</i> and
<i>most</i> to the positive degree.</b></p>

<p>Many adjectives of two syllables and most adjectives of
three or more syllables are so compared. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example inline">
  <li>recent, more recent, most recent;</li>
  <li>terrible, more terrible, most terrible;</li>
  <li>triumphant, more triumphant, most triumphant;</li>
  <li>economical, more economical, most economical.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>profound,</li>
    <li>sublime,</li>
    <li>unkind.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The adverbs <i>less</i> and <i>least</i> may be used with an adjective, if one
wishes to run <i>down</i> the scale of comparison: as,—<i>terrible</i>, <i>less terrible</i>, <i>least
terrible</i>. This idiom, however, should not be regarded as comparison of the
adjective. “Superlative” means “in the highest degree,” and is not applicable
to <i>least terrible</i>, which means “terrible in the <i>lowest</i> degree.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="subtitle">ADVERBS</span></h3>

<p id="s-189"><b>189.</b> <b>An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective, or
another adverb.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The storm ceased <i>suddenly</i>.</li>
  <li>A <i>very</i> disastrous storm swept the coast.</li>
  <li>The storm ceased <i>very</i> suddenly.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-190"><b>190.</b> Adverbs are classified according to their meaning as:
(1) adverbs of <b>manner</b>; (2) adverbs of <b>time</b>; (3) adverbs of
<b>place</b>; (4) adverbs of <b>degree</b>.<a href="#footnote-24" id="marker-24" class="marker" title="Footnote 24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p id="s-190-1">1. Adverbs of manner answer the question “How?” “In
what way?”</p>

<p>They modify verbs or adjectives, rarely adverbs. Most of
them are formed from adjectives by adding <i>ly</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Tom answered <i>courageously</i>.</li>
  <li>The poor child looked <i>helplessly</i> about.</li>
  <li><i>Softly</i> and <i>silently</i> fell the snow.</li>
  <li>The pain was <i>terribly</i> severe.</li>
  <li>The river rose <i>surprisingly</i> fast.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-190-2">2. Adverbs of time answer the question “When?” They
usually modify verbs. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The old castle is <i>now</i> a museum.</li>
  <li>He was <i>recently</i> promoted.</li>
  <li>I have been disturbed <i>lately</i>.</li>
  <li>My friend arrives <i>to-day</i>.</li>
  <li>James was <i>then</i> a boy of seven.</li>
  <li>I have <i>already</i> rung the bell.</li>
  <li><i>Afterwards</i> he regretted his haste.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-190-3"><a id="page-84" href="#page-84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a>
3. Adverbs of place answer the question “Where?” They
usually modify verbs. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Come <i>here</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Yonder</i> stands the culprit.</li>
  <li>An old sailor came <i>forward</i>.</li>
  <li>My sister is <i>out</i>.</li>
  <li>I was <i>abroad</i> that winter.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-190-4">4. Adverbs of degree answer the question “To what degree
or extent?” They modify verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Arthur is <i>rather</i> tall.</li>
  <li>Father was <i>much</i> pleased.</li>
  <li>Father was <i>very much</i> pleased.</li>
  <li>The task seemed <i>utterly</i> hopeless.</li>
  <li>That is <i>hardly</i> possible.</li>
  <li>That is <i>not</i> possible.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-191"><b>191.</b> Some adverbs have the same form as the corresponding
adjectives.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You have guessed <i>right</i>.</li>
  <li>How <i>fast</i> the tide ebbs!</li>
  <li>The horse was sold <i>cheap</i>.</li>
  <li>Tired men sleep <i>sound</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title">Other examples are:—</span>
  <ul>
    <li>wrong,</li>
    <li>straight,</li>
    <li>early,</li>
    <li>late,</li>
    <li>quick,</li>
    <li>hard,</li>
    <li>far,</li>
    <li>near,</li>
    <li>slow,</li>
    <li>high,</li>
    <li>low,</li>
    <li>loud,</li>
    <li>ill,</li>
    <li>well,</li>
    <li>deep,</li>
    <li>close,</li>
    <li>just,</li>
    <li>very,</li>
    <li>much,</li>
    <li>little.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Under this head come certain adverbs of degree used to
modify adjectives.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>His eyes were <i>dark</i> blue. [Compare: <i>very</i> blue.]</li>
  <li>That silk is <i>light</i> yellow. [Compare: <i>rather</i> yellow.]</li>
  <li>These flowers are <i>deep</i> purple. [Compare: <i>intensely</i> purple.]</li>
  <li>The water was <i>icy</i> cold. [Compare: <i>extremely</i> cold.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
That <i>dark</i>, <i>light</i>, etc., are adverbs in this use appears from the fact that
they answer the question “How?” Thus,—“His eyes were blue.” “<i>How</i>
blue?” “<i>Dark</i> blue.”</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In the oldest English many adverbs ended in <i>-ë</i>, as if formed
directly from adjectives by means of this ending. Thus, the adjective for <i>hot</i>
was <i>hāt</i>, side by side with which was an adverb <i>hātë</i> (dissyllabic), meaning
<i>hotly</i>. In the fourteenth century this distinction was still kept up. Thus,
<a id="page-85" href="#page-85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a>
Chaucer used both the adjective <i>hōt</i> and the dissyllabic adverb <i>hōtë</i>, meaning
<i>hotly</i>. Between 1400 and 1500 all weak final <i>e</i>’s disappeared from the language.
In this way the adverb <i>hotë</i>, for example, became simply <i>hot</i>. Thus these adverbs
in <i>-ë</i> became identical in form with the corresponding adjectives. Hence
in the time of Shakspere there existed, in common use, not only the adjective
<i>hot</i>, but also the adverb <i>hot</i> (identical in form with the adjective but really
descended from the adverb <i>hotë</i>). One could say not only “The fire is <i>hot</i>”
(adjective), but “The fire burns <i>hot</i>” (adverb of manner).</p>

<p>The tendency in modern English has been to confine the form without ending
to the adjective use and to restrict the adverbial function to forms in <i>-ly</i>.
Thus, a writer of the present time would not say, in prose, “The fire burns
<i>hot</i>,” but “The fire burns <i>hotly</i>.” Nevertheless, a number of the old adverbs
without ending still remain in good use, and must not be regarded as erroneous.</p>

<p>In poetry, moreover, such adverbs are freely employed; as,—“The boy
like a gray goshawk stared <i>wild</i>.” [In prose: stared <i>wildly</i>.]</p>

<p id="s-192"><b>192.</b> <i>Yes</i> and <i>no</i> are peculiar adverbs used in assenting and
denying. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Are you hungry?</p>
<p>No.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> As now used, <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> stand for complete sentences. Originally,
however, they were modifiers, and hence they are still classed as adverbs.
The original meaning of <i>no</i> was “never.” Compare <i>never</i> as an emphatic
negative in modern English: as,—“Will you surrender?” “<i>Never!</i>” The
oldest affirmative adverb was <i>yea</i>. <i>Yes</i> was originally a compound of <i>yea</i>
with a form of <i>so</i>, and was used in emphatic affirmatives (like our <i>just so!</i>).</p>

<p>Other adverbs or adverbial phrases are sometimes used like <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>.
Such are <i>certainly</i>, <i>assuredly</i>, <i>by no means</i>, <i>not at all</i>. In these cases, however,
the modifying effect of the word or phrase may easily be seen when the
sentence is supplied. Thus,—“Will you help me?” “<i>Certainly</i> [I <i>will
help</i> you].”</p>
</div>

<p id="s-193"><b>193.</b> <i>There</i> is often used merely to introduce a sentence in
the inverted order (<a href="#s-5">§&nbsp;5</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>There is a hole in my shoe.</li>
  <li>There are many strangers in town.</li>
  <li>There rose a thick smoke from the volcano.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this use, <i>there</i> is sometimes called an <b>expletive</b> (or “filler”).
It is unemphatic, and has lost all its force as an adverb of place.
Contrast “<span class="smcap">There</span> [emphatic] stood an Indian under a tree” with,
“There [unemphatic expletive] stood an Indian under a tree.”</p>

<h4>RELATIVE AND INTERROGATIVE ADVERBS</h4>

<p id="s-194"><b>194.</b> <b>Relative adverbs introduce subordinate clauses and are similar
in their use to relative pronouns.</b></p>

<p class="example">
I know a farmhouse {in which | <i>where</i>} we can spend the night.</p>

<p><i>Where</i> is an adverb of place, modifying <i>can spend</i>. But it also
introduces the subordinate clause, as the relative pronoun <i>which</i>
does. Hence <i>where</i> is called a <b>relative adverb</b>.</p>

<p id="s-195"><b>195.</b> The principal relative adverbs are:—<i>where</i>, <i>whence</i>,
<i>whither</i>, <i>wherever</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>whenever</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i>, <i>before</i>,
<i>after</i>, <i>till</i>, <i>until</i>, <i>since</i>.</p>

<p class="note">
Because of their similarity to conjunctions, these words are often called
<b>conjunctive adverbs</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He had a fever <i>when</i> he was in Spain.</li>

  <li>Work <i>while</i> it is day.</li>

  <li><i>As</i> the ship passed, we observed that her decks were crowded with
  Malays. [Time.]</li>

  <li>Keep to the right, <i>as</i> the law directs. [Manner.]</li>

  <li>You started <i>before</i> I was ready.</li>

  <li>Wait <i>until</i> the car stops.</li>

  <li><i>Since</i> you came, it has rained constantly.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<i>As</i> and <i>since</i> in the sense of “because,” and <i>while</i> in the sense of “although,”
are classed as conjunctions (<a href="#s-368">§&nbsp;368</a>).</p>

<p>The clauses introduced by relative adverbs may be either
adjective or adverbial (<a href="#s-49">§§&nbsp;49–50</a>, <a href="#s-379">379–382</a>).</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> In “<i>The</i> more you waste, <i>the</i> sooner you will want” (and similar
sentences) <i>the</i> is not an article, but an old case-form of the pronoun <i>that</i>, used
as an adverb of degree. We may expand the sentence as follows: “<i>To what
extent</i> you waste more, <i>to that extent</i> you will want sooner.” Thus it appears
that the first <i>the</i> has a relative force, and the second <i>the</i> a demonstrative force.</p>

<p id="s-196"><b>196.</b> <b>An interrogative adverb introduces a question.</b></p>

<p><i>Where</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>whence</i>, <i>whither</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i>, may be used as
<b>interrogative adverbs</b>. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Where</i> are you going?</li>
  <li><i>Why</i> must you go?</li>
</ul>
<a id="page-87" href="#page-87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>

<h4>COMPARISON OF ADVERBS</h4>

<p id="s-197"><b>197.</b> <b>Adverbs have three degrees of comparison,—the positive, the

<h4>USE OF THE COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE</h4>

<p id="s-199"><b>199.</b> <b>The comparative degree, not the superlative, is used in comparing
two persons or things.</b></p>

<p><b>The superlative is used in comparing one person or thing with two
or more.</b></p>

<p>The same principle applies to adverbs.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>John runs <i>faster</i> than Tom. [Here the acts of two persons are compared.]</li>

  <li>Which of you three can run <i>fastest</i>? [Here the acts of more than two
  are compared.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English the superlative sometimes occurs when only two
objects are thought of. This use is still found in a few proverbial phrases:
as,—“Put your <i>best</i> foot <i>foremost</i>.”</p>

<p id="s-200"><b>200.</b> The superlative is sometimes used merely for emphasis,
without implying any definite comparison: as—“My <i>dearest</i>
Kate!”</p>

<p>The superlative of emphasis is very common with <i>most</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Most potent</i>, <i>grave</i>, and <i>reverend</i> signiors.<span class="attribution">—Shakspere.</span></li>
  <li>Justice had been <i>most cruelly</i> defrauded.<span class="attribution">—Wordsworth.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p>Excessive use of this construction (like frequent repetition of <i>very</i>) is tiresome
and weakens style.</p>

<p>Double comparison (as <i>more worthier</i>, <i>most unkindest</i>) is common in older
English, but is now a gross error.</p>
</div>

<p id="s-201"><b>201.</b> When two adjectives or adverbs are contrasted by
means of <i>than</i>, <i>more</i> is used with the first.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Such indulgence is <i>more kind</i> than wise.</li>
  <li>This scheme is <i>more clever</i> than honest.</li>
  <li>He acts <i>more boldly</i> than discreetly.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> The adverb <i>rather</i> is often used with the first adjective or adverb
(as,—“<i>rather</i> kind than wise” or “kind <i>rather</i> than wise”<!--TN: added end quote-->), but in a slightly
different sense.</p>

<p id="s-202"><a id="page-89" href="#page-89" class="pagenum" title="89"></a>
<b>202.</b> Many adjectives and adverbs are, from their meaning,
incapable of comparison. Such are:—</p>

<p>1. Adjectives expressing a quality as absolute or complete,
and adverbs derived from such adjectives.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>unique,</li>
    <li>universal,</li>

  </ul>
</div>

<p>2. The adverbs <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>when</i>, and the like.</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> Words like <i>perfect</i>, <i>exact</i>, <i>straight</i>, etc., are commonly said to be
incapable of comparison, but this is an error. For each of these words may
vary in sense. When <i>perfect</i> (for example) denotes <i>absolute perfection</i>, it
cannot be compared. But <i>perfect</i> has also another sense: namely, “partaking
in a higher or lower degree of the qualities that make up absolute perfection,”
so that we may describe one statue as <i>more perfect</i> than another, or one of
three statues as the <i>most perfect</i> of them all. In this use, which is unobjectionable,
we simply admit that nothing in the world is absolutely flawless,
and assert that the three statues approach ideal perfection in various degrees.</p>

<p id="s-203"><b>203.</b> An adjective phrase may sometimes be compared by
means of <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I was never <i>more out of humor</i> [= more vexed].</li>
  <li>I think your last suggestion <i>most in keeping</i> [= most appropriate].</li>
</ul>

<h4>NUMERALS—ADJECTIVES, NOUNS, AND ADVERBS</h4>

<p id="s-204"><b>204.</b> <b>Words indicating number are called numerals. They are adjectives,
nouns, or adverbs.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>There are <i>seven</i> days in the week. [Adjective.]</li>
  <li><i>Twelve</i> make a <i>dozen</i>. [Noun.]</li>
  <li>I have called <i>twice</i>. [Adverb.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-205"><b>205.</b> The chief classes of numerals are <b>cardinals</b> and <b>ordinals</b>.</p>

<p id="s-205-1">1. <b>Cardinal numeral adjectives (<i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, <i>four</i>, etc.) are used in
counting, and answer the question “How many?”</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I had to pay <i>three</i> dollars.</li>
  <li>There were <i>forty-two</i> vessels in the fleet.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> In such expressions as “The boy was <i>sixteen</i>,” the numeral is a
predicate adjective limiting <i>boy</i> (<a href="#s-172-3">§&nbsp;172, 3</a>). We need not expand <i>sixteen</i> to
“sixteen years old.”</p>

<p id="s-205-2"><a id="page-90" href="#page-90" class="pagenum" title="90"></a>
2. <b>Ordinal numeral adjectives (<i>first</i>, <i>second</i>, <i>third</i>, etc.) denote the
position or order of a person or thing in a series.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Carl plays the <i>second</i> violin.</li>
  <li>Your friend is sitting in the <i>fifth</i> row.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-206"><b>206.</b> All the cardinal and ordinal numerals may become
nouns and may take a plural ending in some of their senses.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>One</i> is enough.</li>
  <li><i>Four</i> are missing.</li>
  <li>The <i>nine</i> played an excellent game.</li>
  <li>Three <i>twos</i> are six.</li>
  <li>The men formed by <i>fours</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Thousands</i> perished by the way.</li>
  <li>Eight is two <i>thirds</i> of twelve. [So regularly in <b>fractional parts</b>.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Hundred</i>, <i>thousand</i>, <i>million</i> were originally nouns, but are now
equally common as adjectives. Other numeral nouns are:—twain, couple,
pair, brace, trio, quartette, quintette, foursome, dozen, score, century.</p>

<p id="s-207"><b>207.</b> Certain numeral adjectives (<i>single</i>, <i>double</i>, <i>triple</i>, etc.)
indicate how many times a thing is taken or of how many like
parts it consists.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>A <i>double</i> row of policemen stood on guard.</li>
  <li>A <i>fourfold</i> layer of chilled steel forms the door.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these words may be used as adverbs.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The cabman charged <i>double</i>.</li>
  <li>His fear increased <i>tenfold</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-208"><b>208.</b> Certain numeral adverbs and adverbial phrases indicate
how many times an action takes place.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Once</i> my assailant slipped.</li>
  <li>I rang the bell <i>twice</i>.</li>
  <li>The river hath <i>thrice</i> flow’d, no ebb between.<span class="attribution">—Shakspere.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
The only adverbs of this kind in ordinary use are <i>once</i> and <i>twice</i>. For
larger numbers an adverbial phrase (<i>three times</i>, <i>four times</i>, etc.) is employed.
<i>Thrice</i>, however, is still common in poetry and the solemn style.</p>

<span class="subtitle">VERBS</span></h3>

<h4>CLASSIFICATION OF VERBS</h4>

<p id="s-209"><b>209.</b> <b>A verb is a word which can assert something (usually an
action) concerning a person, place, or thing</b> (<a href="#s-14">§&nbsp;14</a>).</p>

<p>Most verbs express <b>action</b>. Some, however, merely express
<b>state</b> or <b>condition</b>. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example numbered">
  <li><span class="float-l">1.</span> We <i>jumped</i> for joy.</li>
  <li>Rabbits <i>burrow</i> into the sides of hills.</li>
  <li><span class="float-l">2.</span> While memory <i>lasts</i>, I can never forget you.</li>
  <li>This mountain <i>belongs</i> to the Appalachian range.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>A verb-phrase is a group of words that is used as a verb (<a href="#s-15">§&nbsp;15</a>).</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The leaves <i>are turning</i>.</li>
  <li>The money <i>has been found</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-210"><b>210.</b> Certain verbs, when used to make verb-phrases, are
called auxiliary (that is, “aiding”) verbs, because they help
other verbs to express action or state of some particular
kind (<a href="#s-16">§&nbsp;16</a>).</p>

<p>The auxiliary verbs are <i>is</i> (<i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>were</i>, etc.), <i>may</i>, <i>can</i>,
<i>must</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>should</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>had</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>did</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I am writing.</li>
  <li>We must go.</li>
  <li>You will fall.</li>
  <li>He has forgotten me.</li>
  <li>We had failed.</li>
  <li>I do see him.</li>
</ul>

<p>The auxiliary verb may be separated from the rest of the
verb-phrase by other words.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>have</i> always <i>liked</i> him.</li>
  <li>I <i>shall</i> soon <i>send</i> for you.</li>
  <li>Robert <i>was</i> completely <i>bewildered</i>.</li>
  <li>He <i>has</i> hardly ever <i>spoken</i> to me.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-211"><a id="page-92" href="#page-92" class="pagenum" title="92"></a>
<b>211.</b> Verbs are either <b>transitive</b> or <b>intransitive</b> (<a href="#s-99">§&nbsp;99</a>).</p>

<p><b>Some verbs may be followed by a substantive denoting that which
receives the action or is produced by it. These are called transitive
verbs. All other verbs are called intransitive.</b></p>

<p><b>A substantive that completes the meaning of a transitive verb is
called its direct object.</b></p>

<p>In the following sentences, the first four verbs are <b>transitive</b>
(with objects), the last five are <b>intransitive</b> (without objects):—</p>

  <li>The words <i>differ</i> in a single letter.</li>

<p>There is a sharp contrast between a transitive verb used
absolutely and a real intransitive verb. To the former we can
always add an object; with the latter no object is possible.</p>

<p id="s-214"><a id="page-93" href="#page-93" class="pagenum" title="93"></a>
<b>214.</b> <i>Is</i> (in its various forms) and several other verbs may
be used to frame sentences in which some word or words in
the predicate describe or define the subject (<a href="#s-17">§&nbsp;17</a>).</p>

<p>Such verbs are called <b>copulative</b> (that is, “joining”) verbs.</p>

<p class="note">
<i>Is</i> in this use is often called the <b>copula</b> (or “link”).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Time <i>is</i> money.</li>
  <li>Grant <i>was</i> a tireless worker.</li>
  <li>Macbeth <i>became</i> a tyrant.</li>
  <li>His swans always <i>prove</i> geese.</li>
  <li>The current <i>is</i> sluggish.</li>
  <li>Lions <i>are</i> carnivorous.</li>
  <li>This village <i>looks</i> prosperous.</li>
  <li>The consul’s brow <i>grew</i> stern.</li>
  <li>The queen <i>turned</i> pale.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first four examples, the copulative verb (the simple
predicate<a href="#footnote-26" id="marker-26" class="marker" title="Footnote 26"><sup>26</sup></a>) is followed by a predicate nominative (<a href="#s-88-2">§&nbsp;88, 2</a>);
in the last five by a predicate adjective (<a href="#s-172-3">§&nbsp;172, 3</a>).</p>

<p class="note">
The copulative verbs are intransitive, since they take no object. Sometimes,
however, they are regarded as a third class distinct both from transitive
and intransitive verbs.</p>

<p id="s-215"><b>215.</b> The verb <i>is</i> is not always a copula. It is sometimes
emphatic and has the sense of <i>exist</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I think. Therefore I <i>am</i>. [That is, I <i>exist</i>.]</li>
  <li>Whatever <i>is</i>, is right. [The second <i>is</i> is the copula.]</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the other copulative verbs may be used in some
sense in which they cease to be copulative.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The lawyer <i>proved</i> his case.</li>
  <li>Walnut trees <i>grow</i> slowly.</li>
  <li>Mr. Watson <i>grows</i> peaches.</li>
  <li>The wheel <i>turned</i> slowly on the axle.</li>
  <li>He <i>turned</i> his head and <i>looked</i> at me.</li>

<h4>INFLECTION OF VERBS</h4>

<p id="s-216"><b>216.</b> Verbs have inflections of <b>tense</b>, <b>person</b> and <b>number</b>, and
<b>mood</b>. They also have the distinction of <b>voice</b>, which is expressed
by the help of verb-phrases.</p>

<p><b>Tense</b> indicates time; <b>person</b> and <b>number</b> correspond with person
and number in substantives; <b>mood</b> shows the manner in
which the action is expressed; <b>voice</b> indicates whether the
subject acts or is acted upon.</p>

<h5>FORMS OF THE PRESENT AND THE PAST</h5>

<p id="s-218"><b>218.</b> The <b>present</b> and the <b>past</b> tense have special forms of
inflection.</p>

<p>For the moment we will consider the form which the verb
has when its subject is the first personal pronoun <i>I</i>.</p>

<p><b>In the present tense the verb has its simplest form, without any
inflectional ending.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>like</i> it.</li>
  <li>I <i>hope</i> for the best.</li>
  <li>I <i>dwell</i> in the wilderness.</li>
  <li>I <i>find</i> him amusing.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-219"><a id="page-95" href="#page-95" class="pagenum" title="95"></a>
<b>219.</b> The past tense is formed in two ways, and a verb is
classed as <b>weak</b> or <b>strong</b> in accordance with the way in which
it forms this tense.</p>

<p id="s-219-1">1. <b>Weak verbs form the past tense by adding <i>ed</i>, <i>d</i>, or <i>t</i> to the present.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>mend, mended;</li>
    <li>select, selected;</li>
    <li>fill, filled;</li>
    <li>glow, glowed;</li>
    <li>talk, talked;</li>
    <li>revere, revered;</li>
    <li>dwell, dwelt.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p id="s-219-2">2. <b>Strong verbs form the past tense by changing the vowel of the
present, without the addition of an ending.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>drink, drank;</li>
    <li>begin, began;</li>
    <li>come, came;</li>
    <li>rise, rose;</li>
    <li>bind, bound;</li>
    <li>cling, clung;</li>
    <li>stick, stuck;</li>
    <li>wear, wore.<a href="#footnote-29" id="marker-29" class="marker" title="Footnote 29"><sup>29</sup></a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Weak verbs are sometimes called <b>regular</b>, and strong verbs
<b>irregular verbs</b>.</p>

<p>For a list of the strong verbs see <a href="#page-291">pp.&nbsp;291–297</a>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The terms <b>strong</b> and <b>weak</b> were first applied to verbs for a somewhat
fanciful reason. The strong verbs were so called because they seemed to
form the past tense out of their own resources, without calling to their assistance
any ending. The weak verbs were so called because they could not form
the past tense without the aid of the ending <i>ed</i>, <i>d</i>, or <i>t</i>.</p>

<p id="s-220"><b>220.</b> The ending that is written <i>ed</i> is fully pronounced only
when <i>d</i> or <i>t</i> precedes (as,—<i>thread</i>, <i>threaded</i>; <i>attract</i>, <i>attracted</i>).
Otherwise, <i>e</i> is silent, so that the ending becomes, in pronunciation,
<i>d</i> or <i>t</i> (as,—<i>entered</i>, pronounced <i>enter’d</i>; <i>rocked</i>,
pronounced <i>rockt</i>).</p>

<p>In poetry and the solemn style, however, the silent <i>e</i> in the
ending <i>ed</i> is sometimes restored to its ancient rights.</p>

<p id="s-221"><b>221.</b> Many <b>weak verbs</b> show special irregularities in the
<b>past tense</b>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Make</i> has <i>made</i> in the past, and <i>have</i> has <i>had</i>.</p>

<p>2. Some verbs in <i>-nd</i> and <i>-ld</i> form their past tense by changing
this <i>d</i> to <i>t</i>.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>bend, bent;</li>
    <li>send, sent;</li>
    <li>lend, lent;</li>
    <li>rend, rent;</li>
    <li>spend, spent;</li>
    <li>build, built.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p><a id="page-96" href="#page-96" class="pagenum" title="96"></a>
3. A few verbs add <i>d</i> or <i>t</i> in the past and also change the
vowel of the present. Thus,—</p>

<i>worked</i>. For <i>must</i>, <i>would</i>, etc., see <a href="#page-299">p.&nbsp;299</a>.</p>

<p>4. Some verbs that have a long vowel sound in the present
have in the past a short vowel sound before the ending <i>t</i>.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>creep, crept;</li>

    <li>sleep, slept;</li>
    <li>sweep, swept;</li>
    <li>weep, wept;</li>

    <li>deal, dealt (pronounced <i>delt</i>);</li>

    <li>leave, left.<a href="#footnote-30" id="marker-30" class="marker" title="Footnote 30"><sup>30</sup></a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>5. Some verbs in <i>d</i> or <i>t</i> preceded by a long vowel sound have
a short vowel in the past but add no ending.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>bleed, bled;</li>
    <li>breed, bred;</li>
    <li>feed, fed;</li>
    <li>speed, sped;</li>
    <li>lead, led;</li>
    <li>read (pronounced <i>reed</i>), read (pronounced <i>red</i>);</li>
    <li>meet, met;</li>
    <li>light, lit (<i>also</i> lighted).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>6. Some verbs in <i>d</i> or <i>t</i> have in the past the same form as
in the present.</p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>shed, <i>past</i> shed;</li>
    <li>spread, <i>past</i> spread;</li>
    <li>bet, <i>past</i> bet;</li>
    <li>hit, <i>past</i> hit;</li>

    <li>cut, <i>past</i> cut;</li>
    <li>hurt, <i>past</i> hurt;</li>
    <li>cast, <i>past</i> cast.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The verbs in 5 and 6 might appear to be strong verbs, since they
have no ending in the past and some of them change the vowel. They are,
however, all weak verbs. Their lack of ending is due to the fact that the
<i>d</i> or <i>t</i> of the termination has been absorbed in the final <i>d</i> or <i>t</i> of the verb
itself. Thus, the past <i>set</i> was originally <i>settë</i> (dissyllabic), and this form, after
the loss of <i>-ë</i>, became indistinguishable in sound from <i>set</i>, the present.</p>

<h5>PERSON AND NUMBER—THE PERSONAL ENDINGS</h5>

<p id="s-222"><b>222.</b> <b>A verb must agree with its subject in number and person.</b></p>

<p><b>Verbs, like substantives, have two numbers (singular and plural) and
three persons (first, second, and third).</b></p>

<p><b>The singular number denotes a single person or thing. The plural
number denotes more than one person or thing.</b></p>

<p><b>The first person denotes the speaker; the second person denotes the
person spoken to; the third person denotes the person or thing spoken of.</b></p>

<p id="s-223"><b>223.</b> The inflections of <b>person and number</b> in verbs may be

<p>From the sentences it is evident (1) that the <b>person</b> and <b>number</b>
of a verb are usually shown by its subject only, but (2)
that some verb-forms have special <b>endings</b> which denote person
and number.</p>

<p id="s-224"><b>224.</b> <b>The endings by means of which a verb indicates person and
number are called personal endings.</b></p>

<p>1. In the present tense a verb has two personal endings, <i>est</i>
for the second person singular and s for the third person singular
(old form <i>eth</i>).</p>

<p>The first person singular and all three persons of the plural
are alike. The simplest form of the verb is used and no personal
ending is added.</p>

<p><a id="page-98" href="#page-98" class="pagenum" title="98"></a>
2. The past tense has but one personal ending,—<i>est</i> or <i>st</i> in
the second person singular.<a href="#footnote-31" id="marker-31" class="marker" title="Footnote 31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>The forms in <i>est</i> or <i>st</i> are confined to poetry and the solemn
style. In ordinary language, the second person plural is used
to address a single person.</p>

<p class="continued">The disappearance of all weak final <i>e</i>’s in the fifteenth century (<a href="#s-191">§&nbsp;191</a>) reduced
the first person singular and the whole plural to the single form <i>walk</i>. Later,
<i>walks</i> (a dialect form) was substituted for <i>walketh</i>, and still later the second
person singular was replaced in ordinary use by the plural. The result has
been that in modern speech there are only two common forms in the present
tense,—<i>walk</i> and <i>walks</i>. In poetry and the solemn style, however, <i>walkest</i> and
<i>walketh</i> are still in use. The plural in <i>en</i> is frequently adopted by Spenser as
an ancient form (or <b>archaism</b>): as,—“You <i>deemen</i> the spring is come.”</p>

<h6>Special Rules of Number and Person</h6>

<p id="s-226"><b>226.</b> When the subject is compound (<a href="#s-38">§&nbsp;38</a>), the number of
the verb is determined by the following rules:—</p>

<p>1. A compound subject with <i>and</i> usually takes a verb in the
plural number.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>My brother and sister <i>play</i> tennis.</li>
  <li>The governor and the mayor <i>are</i> cousins.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. A compound subject with <i>or</i> or <i>nor</i> takes a verb in the
singular number if the substantives are singular.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Either my brother or my sister <i>is</i> sure to win.</li>
  <li>Neither the governor nor the mayor <i>favors</i> this appointment.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. A compound subject with <i>and</i> expressing but a single
idea sometimes takes a verb in the singular number.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The sum and substance [= gist] of the matter <i>is</i> this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This construction is rare in modern English prose. It is for the
most part confined to such idiomatic phrases as <i>end and aim</i> (= <i>purpose</i>), <i>the
long and short of it</i>, etc. The poets, however, use the construction freely (as
in Kipling’s “The tumult and the shouting dies”).</p>

<p>4. If the substantives connected by <i>or</i> or <i>nor</i> differ in number
or person, the verb usually agrees with the nearer.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Either you or he <i>is</i> to blame.</li>
  <li>Neither you nor he <i>is</i> an Austrian.</li>
  <li>Neither John nor we <i>were</i> at home.</li>
  <li>Neither the mayor nor the aldermen <i>favor</i> this law.</li>
</ul>

<p>But colloquial usage varies, and such expressions are avoided
by careful writers. The following sentences show how this may
be done:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Either you are to blame, or he is.</li>
  <li>One of you two is to blame.</li>
  <li>Neither of you is an Austrian.</li>
  <li>He is not afraid; neither am I.</li>
  <li>Both John and we were away from home.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-227"><a id="page-101" href="#page-101" class="pagenum" title="101"></a>
<b>227.</b> In such expressions as the following, the subject is not
compound, and the verb agrees with its singular subject:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The <i>governor</i> with his staff <i>is</i> present.</li>
  <li><i>John</i>, as well as Mary, <i>is</i> in London.</li>
  <li><i>Tom</i>, along with his friends Dick and Bob, <i>is taking</i> a sail.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-228"><b>228.</b> Nouns that are plural in form but singular in sense
commonly take a verb in the singular number (<a href="#s-84">§&nbsp;84</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Economics <i>is</i> an important study.</li>
  <li>The gallows <i>has been</i> abolished in Massachusetts.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
In some words usage varies. Thus, <i>pains</i>, in the sense of <i>care</i> or <i>effort</i>, is
sometimes regarded as a singular and sometimes as a plural.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Great <i>pains has</i> (or <i>have</i>) been taken about the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-229"><b>229.</b> <b>Collective nouns</b> take sometimes a singular and sometimes
a plural verb.</p>

<p>When the persons or things denoted are thought of as
<b>individuals</b>, the plural should be used. When the collection is
regarded as a <b>unit</b>, the singular should be used.<a href="#footnote-33" id="marker-33" class="marker" title="Footnote 33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. The Senior Class <i>requests</i> the pleasure of your company. [Here the
  class is thought of <b>collectively</b>, acting as a unit.]</li>

  <li>2. The Senior Class <i>are</i> unable to agree upon a president. [Here the
  speaker has in mind the <b>individuals</b> of whom the class is composed.]</li>

  <li>3. The nation <i>welcomes</i> Prince Joseph. [The whole nation unites as a
  single individual to welcome a distinguished guest.]</li>

  <li>4. The American nation <i>are</i> descended from every other nation on
  earth. [The separate qualities of the individuals who constitute the
  nation are in the speaker’s mind.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-230"><b>230.</b> A <i>number</i> in the sense of “several” or “many” regularly
takes the plural; <i>the number</i> takes the singular.<!--TN: added period--></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>A number of sailors <i>were loitering</i> on the pier.</li>
  <li>The number of tickets <i>is limited</i>.</li>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Half</i> of a circle <i>is</i> a semicircle.</li>
  <li><i>Half</i> of the passengers <i>were</i> lost.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-232"><b>232.</b> A verb which has for its subject a <b>relative pronoun</b> is in
the same person and number as the antecedent. For examples,
see <a href="#s-149">§&nbsp;149</a>.</p>

<p>Errors are especially common in such sentences as,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>This is one of the strangest sights that ever <i>were</i> seen. [The antecedent
  of <i>that</i> is <i>sights</i> (not <i>one</i>); hence the relative (<i>that</i>) is plural, and
  accordingly the verb is plural (<i>were</i>, not <i>was</i>).]</li>

  <li>Mr. Winn’s oration was among the most eloquent that <i>have</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>has</i>]
  been delivered in this state for many years.</li>

  <li>This is one of the finest paintings there <i>are</i> in the hall. [For the omission

<h5>THE FUTURE TENSE</h5>

<p id="s-233"><b>233.</b> The <b>future tense</b> is a verb-phrase consisting of the auxiliary
verb <i>shall</i> or <i>will</i> followed by the infinitive without <i>to</i>
(<a href="#s-29">§&nbsp;29</a>).</p>

<p>The following table shows the form of the <b>future</b> for each of
the three persons (1) in <b>assertions</b> and (2) in <b>questions</b>:—</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p id="s-234"><a id="page-103" href="#page-103" class="pagenum" title="103"></a>
<b>234.</b> Common errors are the use of <i>will</i> for <i>shall</i> (1) in the
<b>first person</b> in <b>assertions</b> and <b>questions</b>, and (2) in the <b>second person</b>
in <b>questions</b>.</p>

<p>In the following sentences the first person of the future
tense is correctly formed:—</p>

<table class="type-1" summary="">
  <tr>
    <td>I shall [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>will</i>] drown.</td>
    <td>Shall [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>will</i>] I drown?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I shall [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>will</i>] fail.</td>
    <td>Shall [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>will</i>] I fail?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We shall [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>will</i>] sink.</td>
    <td>Shall [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>will</i>] we sink?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The verb-phrases with <i>shall</i> express merely the action of the
verb in <b>future</b> time. They do not indicate any <b>willingness</b> or
<b>desire</b> on the part of the subject.</p>

<p>Contrast the following sentences, in which <i>I will</i> or <i>we will</i>
is used:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I will go with you.</li>
  <li>I will give you what you ask.</li>
  <li>I will not endure it.</li>
  <li>We will allow you to enter.</li>
  <li>We will have the truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the verb-phrases with <i>will</i> do not (as in the previous
examples of <i>I shall</i>) express the action of the verb in future
time. They express the <b>present willingness</b> or <b>desire</b> or <b>determination</b>
of the speaker to do something in the future.</p>

<p>Hence such verb-phrases with <i>will</i> in the first person are
not forms of the future tense. They are special verb-phrases
expressing willingness or desire.</p>

<p id="s-235"><b>235.</b> <b>In the first person <i>shall</i>, not <i>will</i>, is the auxiliary of the future
tense in both assertions and questions. It denotes simple futurity, without
expressing willingness, desire, or determination</b>.</p>

<p><b><i>Will</i> in the first person is used in promising, threatening, consenting,
and expressing resolution. It never denotes simple futurity.</b></p>

<h6>I. Simple Futurity (Future Tense)</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>I shall be</i> eighteen years old in July. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: <i>will be</i>.]</li>
  <li>Hurry, or <i>we shall miss</i> our train. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: <i>will miss</i>.]</li>
  <li><i>We shall be</i> glad to see him. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: <i>will be</i>.]</li>
</ul>
<a id="page-104" href="#page-104" class="pagenum" title="104"></a>

<h6>II. Promises, Threats, etc.</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>will subscribe</i> to your fund. [Promise.]</li>
  <li>We <i>will do</i> our best. [Promise.]</li>
  <li>I <i>will discharge</i> you if you are late again. [Threat.]</li>
  <li>We <i>will permit</i> you to go. [Consent.]</li>
  <li>I <i>will have</i> obedience. [Resolution.]</li>
</ul>

<p><i>I’ll</i> and <i>we’ll</i> are contractions of <i>I will</i> and <i>we will</i> and can
never stand for <i>I shall</i> and <i>we shall</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>I’ll</i> meet you at noon. [Promise.]</li>
  <li><i>I’ll</i> never consent. [Resolution.]</li>
  <li><i>We’ll</i> be revenged on you. [Threat.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-236"><b>236.</b> When willingness is expressed by an <b>adjective</b>, <i>I shall</i>
is correct; when by an <b>adverb</b>, <i>I will</i>. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>shall be glad</i> to help you.</li>
  <li>I <i>will gladly</i> help you.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Such expressions as <i>I shall be glad</i>, <i>I shall be willing</i>, <i>I shall be
charmed to do this</i>, express willingness not by means of <i>shall</i> but in the adjectives
<i>glad</i>, <i>willing</i>, <i>charmed</i>. To say, “I will be glad to do this,” then, would
be wrong, for it would be to express volition twice. Such a sentence could
only mean “<i>I am determined</i> to be glad to do this.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, in “I <i>will gladly help</i> you,” volition is expressed by the
verb-phrase <i>will help</i> and the adverb merely modifies the phrase by emphasizing
the speaker’s willingness. Hence <i>I will</i> is correct.</p>
</div>

<p id="s-237"><b>237.</b> <i>Will</i>, when <b>emphasized</b>, always expresses determination
on the part of the subject, even in the second and third persons.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <span class="smaller">WILL</span> go, no matter what you say.</li>
  <li>{You <span class="smaller">WILL</span> | He <span class="smaller">WILL</span>}
  act foolishly, in spite of my advice.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-238"><b>238.</b> <b>In the second person <i>Shall you?</i> not <i>Will you?</i> is the proper
form of the future tense in questions.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Will you?</i> always denotes willingness, consent, or determination, and
never simple futurity.</b></p>

<p>Note that in questions in the second person, the auxiliary
used is the same as that expected in the answer.</p>
<a id="page-105" href="#page-105" class="pagenum" title="105"></a>

<h6>I. Future Tense (Simple Futurity)</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Shall</i> you <i>be</i> disappointed if he does not come? [I shall.]</li>
  <li><i>Shall</i> you <i>regret</i> his absence? [I shall.]</li>
  <li><i>Shall</i> you <i>go</i> by boat or by train? [I shall go by boat.]</li>
</ul>

<h6>II. Verb-Phrase denoting Willingness, etc.</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Will</i> you <i>write</i> often? [I will.]</li>
  <li><i>Will</i> you <i>allow</i> me to help you? [I will.]</li>
  <li><i>Will</i> you <i>be</i> so kind as to open the window? [I will.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-239"><b>239.</b> <i>Shall</i> in the <b>second</b> and <b>third persons</b> is not the sign of
the <b>future</b> tense in declarative sentences.</p>

<p>It is used in <b>commanding</b>, <b>promising</b>, <b>threatening</b>, and expressing
<b>resolution</b>, the volition being that of the speaker.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Thou <i>shalt</i> not <i>kill</i>. [Command.]</li>
  <li>You <i>shall have</i> the hat before Monday. [Promise.]</li>
  <li>You <i>shall pay</i> for this insult! [Threat.]</li>
  <li>She <i>shall</i> not <i>regret</i> her generosity. [Resolution.]</li>
</ul>

<p>In prophetic language, <i>shall</i> is common in the second and
third persons, even when there is no idea of commanding or
the like.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The sun <i>shall be turned</i> into darkness and the moon into blood.—<i>Joel</i>
ii. 31.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-240"><b>240.</b> In military orders and official communications, custom
permits the more courteous <i>will</i> in the place of <i>shall</i> in the
second and third persons.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You <i>will</i> immediately report for orders.</li>
  <li>Heads of Departments <i>will submit</i> their estimates before January first.</li>
</ul>

<p>For <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> in subordinate clauses, see <a href="#page-130">pp.&nbsp;130–132</a>.</p>

<p id="s-241"><b>241.</b> Future time may also be expressed by the present
tense, or by <i>about</i> or <i>going</i> with the infinitive (<a href="#s-319">§&nbsp;319</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>We <i>sail</i> for Havana on Tuesday.</li>
  <li>They are <i>about to begin</i> the study of Greek.</li>
</ul>
<a id="page-106" href="#page-106" class="pagenum" title="106"></a>

<h5>COMPLETE OR COMPOUND TENSES</h5>

<p id="s-242"><b>242.</b> <b>Completed action</b> is denoted by special <b>verb-phrases</b> made
by prefixing to the <b>past participle</b> some form of the auxiliary
verb <i>have</i>.</p>

<p>These are called the <b>complete</b> or <b>compound tenses</b>.</p>

<p>There are three <b>complete</b> or <b>compound</b> tenses,—the <b>perfect</b>
(or <b>present perfect</b>), the <b>pluperfect</b> (or <b>past perfect</b>), and the <b>future
perfect</b>.</p>

<p id="s-242-1">1. <b>The perfect (or present perfect) tense denotes that the action of
the verb is complete at the time of speaking. It is formed by prefixing
<i>have</i> (<i>hast</i>, <i>has</i>) to the past participle.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>have learned</i> my lesson.</li>
  <li>He <i>has convinced</i> me.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> With several verbs of motion the auxiliary <i>be</i> is sometimes used
instead of <i>have</i>: as,—“My friends <i>are gone</i>” (or “<i>have gone</i>”); “Your time
<i>is come</i>” (or “<i>has come</i>”).</p>

<p id="s-242-2">2. <b>The pluperfect (or past perfect) tense denotes that the action was
completed at some point in past time. It is formed by prefixing <i>had</i>
(<i>hadst</i>) to the past participle.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Before night fell, I <i>had finished</i> the book.</li>
  <li>When Blake <i>had spoken</i>, Allen rose to reply.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-242-3">3. <b>The future perfect tense denotes that the action will be completed
at some point in future time. It is formed by prefixing the future tense
of <i>have</i> (<i>shall have</i>, etc.) to the past participle.</b></p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Before I hear from you again, I <i>shall have landed</i> at Naples.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">The future perfect tense is rare except in very formal writing.</p>

<p id="s-243"><b>243.</b> The forms of the past participle will be studied in
<a href="#s-334">§&nbsp;334</a>. Meanwhile, the following practical rule will serve every
purpose:—</p>

<p><b>The past participle is that verb-form which is used after <i>I have</i>.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>[I have] mended,</li>
    <li>tried,</li>
    <li>swept,</li>
    <li>bought,</li>

    <li>forgotten,</li>
    <li>found,</li>
    <li>sunk,</li>
    <li>dug.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p id="s-244"><a id="page-107" href="#page-107" class="pagenum" title="107"></a>
<b>244.</b> A verb-phrase made by prefixing <i>having</i> to the past
participle is called the <b>perfect participle</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>Having reached</i> my destination, I stopped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A verb-phrase made by prefixing <i>to have</i> to the past participle
is called the <b>perfect infinitive</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>I am sorry <i>to have missed</i> you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-245"><b>245.</b> Three forms of the verb are so important that they
are called the <b>principal parts</b>. These are:—</p>

<h4>VOICE—ACTIVE AND PASSIVE</h4>

<p id="s-246"><b>246.</b> <b>Voice is that property of verbs which indicates whether the
subject acts or is acted upon.</b></p>

<p>There are two voices, active and passive.</p>

<p id="s-246-1">1. <b>A verb is in the active voice when it represents the subject as the
doer of an act.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Richard <i>shot</i> the bear.</li>
  <li>Mr. Hardy <i>builds</i> carriages.</li>
  <li>Dr. Wilson <i>has cured</i> my father.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-246-2">2. <b>A verb is in the passive voice when it represents the subject as
the receiver or the product of an action.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The bear was <i>shot by</i> Richard.</li>
  <li>Carriages <i>are built</i> by Mr. Hardy.</li>
  <li>My father <i>has been cured</i> by Dr. Wilson.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-247"><a id="page-108" href="#page-108" class="pagenum" title="108"></a>
<b>247.</b> <b>The passive voice of a verb is expressed by a verb-phrase made
by prefixing some form of the copula (is, was, etc.) to the past participle.</b></p>

<p>In the passive voice of the <b>complete tenses</b>, the past participle
<i>been</i> follows the proper form of the auxiliary <i>have</i> (as in the
third example in <a href="#s-246-2">§&nbsp;246, 2</a>).</p>

<p>The passive of the <b>infinitive</b> is made by prefixing <i>to be</i> (perfect,
<i>to have been</i>) to the past participle. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Present infinitive passive</span>: to be struck.</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Perfect infinitive passive</span>: to have been struck.</li>

<h5 class="smcap">Use of the Passive Voice</h5>

<p id="s-249"><b>249.</b> Any sentence of which the predicate is a transitive
verb followed by an object, may be changed from the active
to the passive form without affecting the sense.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Active.</span>   Richard <i>shot</i> the bear.</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Passive.</span>  The bear <i>was shot</i> by Richard.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this change, (1) <i>bear</i>, the object of the active verb
<i>shot</i>, becomes the subject of the passive verb <i>was shot</i>; and
(2) <i>Richard</i>, the subject of the active verb <i>shot</i>, becomes <i>by
Richard</i>, an adverbial phrase, modifying the passive verb <i>was
shot</i>. Thus we have the rule:—</p>

<p><b>The object of the active verb becomes the subject of the passive, and
the subject of the active verb becomes in the passive an adverbial phrase
modifying the predicate verb.</b></p>

my aunt,” either “It was my aunt who gave me this watch” or “This watch

<h4>PROGRESSIVE VERB-PHRASES</h4>

<p id="s-255"><b>255.</b> In addition to the tense-forms already described, verbs
have so-called <b>progressive forms</b>.</p>

<p><b>The progressive form of a tense represents the action of the verb as
going on or continuing at the time referred to.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>ate</i> my dinner.</li>

  <li>I <i>was eating</i> my dinner.</li>

  <li>While I <i>was</i> quietly <i>reading</i> by my fireside, strange things <i>were taking</i>
  place in the square.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both <i>ate</i> and <i>was eating</i> are in the past tense. But <i>ate</i> merely
expresses a past action, whereas <i>was eating</i> describes this action
as <b>continuing</b> or <b>in progress</b> in past time.</p>

<p id="s-256"><b>256.</b> <b>The progressive form is a verb-phrase made by prefixing to
the present participle some form of the verb <i>to be</i>.</b></p>

<b>257.</b> In the passive, the progressive forms are confined to

  <li>I <i>am being trained</i> by Arthur Ray. [Present.]</li>
  <li>When I called, tea <i>was being served</i>. [Past.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-258"><b>258.</b> In subordinate clauses, the verb <i>is</i> (in its various forms)
with its subject is often omitted in progressive phrases.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>While <i>waiting</i> for the train, I bought a newspaper. [That is, While I
  was waiting.]</li>

  <li>Though [he was] <i>swimming</i> vigorously, he could not stem the tide.</li>

  <li>When [I am] <i>reading</i>, I like to have the light shine over my left
  shoulder.</li>

<h4>EMPHATIC VERB-PHRASES</h4>

<p id="s-260"><b>260.</b> <b>The present or the past of a verb in the active voice may be expressed
with emphasis by means of a verb-phrase consisting of <i>do</i> or <i>did</i>
and the infinitive without <i>to</i>.</b></p>

<p><b>Such a phrase is called the emphatic form of the present or past tense.</b></p>

<p class="note">
“I do see you” and “I did go” differ from “I see you” and “I went”
merely in emphasis. Hence <i>do see</i> is called the <b>emphatic form</b> of the present
tense of <i>see</i>, and <i>did go</i> the emphatic form of the past tense of <i>go</i>.</p>

<p id="s-261"><b>261.</b> In questions and in negative statements the emphatic
forms are used without the effect of emphasis.</p>

<p class="example">Did you go? I did not go.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Do</i> often stands for some other verb which has just been used: as,
“Jack <i>swims</i> better than I <i>do</i>,” “You <i>looked</i> as tired as she <i>did</i>.” This idiom
comes from the omission of the infinitive in the verb-phrase:—“Jack swims
better than I <i>do</i> [<i>swim</i>].”</p>

<p>In poetry and older English the verb-phrase with <i>do</i> or <i>did</i> in declarative
sentences often carries no emphasis, but merely takes the place of the present
or past: as,—“The serpent beguiled me, and I <i>did eat</i>.”</p>
</div>
<a id="page-115" href="#page-115" class="pagenum" title="115"></a>

<h4>MOOD OF VERBS</h4>

<p id="s-262"><b>262.</b> <b>Mood is that property of verbs which shows the manner in
which the action or state is expressed.</b></p>

<p class="note">
<b>Mood</b> (or <b>mode</b>) is derived from the Latin word <i>modus</i>, “manner.”</p>

<p>Compare the following sentences, noting the form of the
verb in each:</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Richard <i>is</i> quiet.</li>
  <li><i>Is</i> Richard quiet?</li>
  <li>If Richard <i>were</i> quiet, I might study.</li>
  <li>Richard, <i>be</i> quiet.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first and second sentences, the form <i>is</i> is used to assert
or question a <b>fact</b>; in the third, the form <i>were</i> expresses a <b>condition</b>
or <b>supposition</b> that is contrary to fact; in the fourth, the
form <i>be</i> expresses a <b>command</b> or <b>request</b>.</p>

<p>The difference in form seen in the verb in these sentences is
called a difference of <b>mood</b>.</p>

<p id="s-263"><b>263.</b> <b>There are three moods,—the indicative, the imperative, and
the subjunctive.</b></p>

<p id="s-263-1">1. <b>The indicative is the mood of simple assertion or interrogation, but
it is used in other constructions also.</b></p>

<p id="s-263-2">2. <b>The imperative is the mood of command or request.</b></p>

<p id="s-263-3">3. <b>The subjunctive mood is used in certain special constructions of
wish, condition, and the like.</b></p>

<p>Thus, in the examples in <a href="#s-262">§&nbsp;262</a>, <i>is</i> is in the <b>indicative</b>, <i>were</i>
in the <b>subjunctive</b>, and <i>be</i> in the <b>imperative</b> mood.</p>

<h5>I. INDICATIVE MOOD</h5>

<p id="s-264"><b>264.</b> The ordinary <b>forms</b> of the <b>indicative mood</b> in the active
and the passive voice and in all six tenses,—present, past,
future, perfect (or present perfect), pluperfect (or past perfect),
and future perfect,—may be seen in the table on <a href="#page-108">pp.&nbsp;108–110</a>.</p>

<p>For the <b>progressive form</b> of the indicative, see <a href="#s-256">§&nbsp;256</a>; for the
<b>emphatic form</b>, see <a href="#s-260">§&nbsp;260</a>.</p>

<p id="s-265"><a id="page-116" href="#page-116" class="pagenum" title="116"></a>
<b>265.</b> The commonest <b>uses</b> of the <b>indicative mood</b> are in statements
or questions as to matters of fact; but it may express
almost any other form of thought. Thus,</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Time and tide <i>wait</i> for no man. [Assertion.]</li>
  <li>How <i>goes</i> the world with you? [Interrogation.]</li>
  <li>How it <i>rains</i>! [Exclamation.]</li>
  <li>If the river <i>rises</i>, the dam will be swept away. [Supposition.]</li>
  <li>I suspect that he <i>has absconded</i>. [Doubt.]</li>
  <li>I hope that John <i>will come</i> soon. [Desire.]</li>
  <li>Though Ellen <i>dislikes</i> algebra, she never shirks. [Concession.]</li>
  <li>You <i>will report</i> for duty immediately. [Command.]</li>
  <li><i>Will</i> you <i>allow</i> me to use your knife? [Request.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The indicative and the subjunctive were originally quite distinct
in form, and each had its own set of constructions. But, as our language has
grown simpler in its structure, the forms of these two moods have become
almost identical, and the uses of the indicative have been greatly multiplied
at the expense of the subjunctive. Indeed, there is scarcely any variety of
thought expressed by the subjunctive or the imperative for which the indicative
cannot also be employed. It is therefore impossible to frame any satisfactory
definition of the indicative. Its functions are too varied to be included in
one general statement. The indicative is often described as the mood which
asserts thought <i>as a fact</i>, and the subjunctive as the mood which expresses
thought as supposition (or <i>as mere thought</i>). But the indicative, as well as the
subjunctive, may express supposition, condition, doubt, desire, concession, etc.
Hence the definitions in <a href="#s-263">§&nbsp;263</a> are as exact as the facts of the language allow.
All the efforts of grammarians to devise more “accurate” definitions break
down when tested by actual usage.</p>

<h5>II. IMPERATIVE MOOD</h5>

<p id="s-266"><b>266.</b> <b>The imperative is the mood of command or request.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Hurry!</i></li>
  <li><i>Lie</i> down.</li>
  <li><i>Shut</i> the door.</li>
  <li><i>Have</i> patience.</li>
  <li><i>Light</i> the lamp.</li>
  <li><i>Show</i> us the way.</li>
  <li><i>Wait</i> a moment.</li>
  <li><i>Come</i> to dinner.</li>
</ul>

<p>The imperative has both voices, <b>active</b> and <b>passive</b>, but only
one tense,—the <b>present</b>. It has both numbers, the <b>singular</b> and
the <b>plural</b>, but only one person, the <b>second</b>. It has the same
form for both the <b>singular</b> and the <b>plural</b>.</p>

<p id="s-267"><a id="page-117" href="#page-117" class="pagenum" title="117"></a>
<b>267.</b> 1. <b>The imperative active is the verb in its simplest form.</b></p>

<p>For examples, see <a href="#s-266">§&nbsp;266</a>.</p>

<p>The imperative of the verb <i>to be</i> is <i>be</i>. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Be</i> brave.</li>
  <li><i>Be</i> careful.</li>
  <li><i>Be</i> sure you are right.</li>
  <li><i>Be</i> here at noon.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <b>The imperative passive is a verb-phrase consisting of be and a
past participle.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Be trusted</i> rather than feared.</li>
  <li>Study your failures and <i>be instructed</i> by them.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-268"><b>268.</b> <b>The subject of an imperative is seldom expressed unless it is
emphatic.</b></p>

<p>The subject, when expressed, may precede the imperative:
as,—<i>You sit here</i>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English, the subject often followed the imperative: as,—<i>Go
thou, Go you, Hear ye.</i> This use is now confined to the solemn style and
to poetry.</p>

<p id="s-269"><b>269.</b> The <b>emphatic form</b> of the imperative consists of the imperative
<i>do</i>, followed by the infinitive without <i>to</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Do tell</i> me what he said.</li>
  <li><i>Do stand</i> still.</li>
</ul>

<p>The form with <i>do</i> is often used when the subject is expressed
as,—<i>Do you remain</i>.</p>

<p id="s-270"><b>270.</b> <b>Prohibition</b> (or <b>negative command</b>) is commonly expressed
by means of the form with <i>do</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Do</i> not <i>open</i> a closed door without knocking.</li>
  <li><i>Do</i> not <i>forget</i> to say “thank you.”</li>
</ul>

<p>In poetry and the solemn style prohibition is often expressed
by the simple imperative with <i>not</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Tell</i> me <i>not</i> what too well I know.</li>
  <li><i>Devise not</i> evil against thy neighbor.</li>
  <li><i>Seek not</i> to learn my name.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-271"><a id="page-118" href="#page-118" class="pagenum" title="118"></a>
<b>271.</b> Commands are sometimes expressed in the indicative
by means of <i>shall</i> or <i>will</i> (<a href="#s-239">§§&nbsp;239–240</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Thou <i>shalt</i> not <i>steal</i>.</li>
  <li>You <i>will leave</i> the room immediately.</li>

<p id="s-272"><b>272.</b> <b>The subjunctive mood is used in certain special constructions
of wish, condition, and the like.</b></p>

<p>In older English, the <b>subjunctive</b> forms were common in a
variety of uses, as they still are in poetry and the solemn
style. In ordinary prose, however, subjunctive forms are rare,
and in conversation they are hardly ever heard, except in the
case of the <b>copula</b> <i>be</i>.</p>

<p>The subjunctive forms of <i>be</i> are the following:—</p>

<p class="note">
<i>If</i> is used in the paradigm because it is in clauses beginning with <i>if</i> that
the subjunctive is commonest in modern English; but <i>if</i> is of course no part
of the subjunctive inflection.</p>

<p id="s-273"><b>273.</b> In other verbs, the <b>subjunctive active</b> has the same forms
as the <b>indicative</b>, except in the <b>second</b> and <b>third persons singular</b>
of the <b>present</b> and the <b>perfect</b>, which are like the <b>first</b> person:—</p>

<p>In the <b>passive subjunctive</b>, the subjunctive forms of the copula
(<a href="#s-272">§&nbsp;272</a>) are used as auxiliaries:—present, <i>If I be struck</i>; past,
<i>If I were struck</i>; perfect, <i>If I have been struck</i>; pluperfect, <i>If
I had been struck</i>. (See table, <a href="#page-304">p.&nbsp;304</a>.)</p>

<p id="s-274"><b>274.</b> <b>Progressive verb-phrases</b> in the subjunctive may be formed
by means of the copula:—present, <i>If I be striking</i>; past, <i>If I
were striking</i>. The present is rare; the past is common.</p>

<h6>Uses of the Subjunctive</h6>

<p class="h7">Subjunctive in Wishes and Exhortations</p>

<p id="s-275"><b>275.</b> <b>The subjunctive is often used in wishes or prayers.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Angels and ministers of grace <i>defend</i> us!</li>
  <li>Heaven <i>help</i> him!</li>
  <li>The saints <i>preserve</i> us!</li>
  <li>God <i>bless</i> you!</li>
  <li>Long <i>live</i> the king!</li>
  <li>O that <i>I had listened</i> to him!</li>
  <li>O that we <i>were</i> rid of him!</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-120" href="#page-120" class="pagenum" title="120"></a>
In the first five examples, the wish is expressed in an independent
sentence. In the last two, the construction is subordinate,—the
<i>that</i>-clause being the object of an unexpressed
“I wish” (<a href="#s-407">§&nbsp;407</a>).</p>

<p id="s-276"><b>276.</b> The subjunctive <i>be</i> is often omitted when it may easily
be supplied.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Peace [<i>be</i>] to his ashes!</li>
  <li>Honor [<i>be</i>] to his memory!</li>
  <li>Honor [<i>be</i>] to whom honor is due!</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-277"><b>277.</b> Wishes are often introduced by <i>may</i> or <i>would</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>May</i> you never want!</li>
  <li><i>Would</i> that he <i>were</i> safe!</li>
  <li><i>Would</i> you <i>were</i> with us! [For <i>Would that</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<i>May</i> and <i>would</i> in such expressions were originally subjunctives; <i>would</i>
stands for <i>I would</i>, that is, <i>I should wish</i>. <i>Want</i> in the first example is an
infinitive without <i>to</i> (<a href="#s-311">§&nbsp;311</a>). For wishes expressed by the infinitive, see <a href="#s-320">§&nbsp;320</a>.</p>

<p id="s-278"><b>278.</b> <b>Exhortations</b> in the first person plural sometimes take
the subjunctive in elevated or poetical style.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Hear we</i> the king!</li>
  <li><i>Join we</i> in a hymn of praise!</li>
</ul>

<p>Exhortation is ordinarily expressed by <i>let us</i> followed by
the infinitive without <i>to</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Let us join hands.</li>
  <li>Let us have peace.</li>
  <li>Let’s camp here.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<i>Let</i> is a verb in the imperative mood, <i>us</i> is its object, and the infinitive
(<i>join</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>camp</i>) depends on <i>let</i>.</p>

<p class="h7">Subjunctives in Concessions, Conditions, etc.</p>

<p id="s-279"><b>279.</b> <b>The subjunctive is used after <i>though</i>, <i>although</i>, to express an
admission or concession not as a fact but as a supposition.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Though he <i>slay</i> me, yet will I trust in him.</li>
  <li>Though he <i>were</i> to beg this on his knees, I should still refuse.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-121" href="#page-121" class="pagenum" title="121"></a>
When the concession is stated as an admitted <b>fact</b>, the <b>indicative</b>
is regular.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Although he <i>is</i> a foreigner, he speaks good English.</li>
  <li>Though he sometimes <i>sings</i>, he is not now in good voice.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-280"><b>280.</b> After <i>if</i> and <i>unless</i>, expressing <b>condition</b>, the <b>subjunctive</b>
may be used in a variety of ways.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. If this <i>be</i> gold, our fortune is made. [It may or may not be gold.]</li>

  <li>2. If he <i>confess</i>, I shall overlook the offence. [He may or may not
  confess.]</li>

  <li>3. Unless he <i>confess</i>, he cannot be convicted. [He may or may not
  confess.]</li>

  <li>4. If this <i>were</i> gold, our fortune would be made. [It is <i>not</i> gold; hence
  our fortune is not made.]</li>

  <li>5. If he <i>stood</i> before me at this moment, I should tell him my opinion.
  [He does <i>not</i> stand before me; hence I do not tell him.]</li>

  <li>6. If he <i>had confessed</i>, I should have overlooked his fault. [He did
  not confess; hence I did not overlook it.]</li>

  <li>7. Unless he <i>had confessed</i>, he could not have been convicted. [He
  did confess; hence he was convicted.]</li>
</ul>

<p>In conditional clauses, the <b>present subjunctive</b> denotes either
<b>present</b> or <b>future</b> time. It puts the supposed case doubtfully, but
not necessarily as improbable. (See examples 1–3.)</p>

<p>The <b>past subjunctive</b> refers to <b>present</b> time. It implies that
the supposed case <b>is not now a fact</b>. (See examples 4 and 5.)</p>

<p>The <b>pluperfect</b> (or <b>past perfect</b>) <b>subjunctive</b> refers to <b>past</b> time.
It implies that the supposed case <b>was not a fact</b>. (See 6 and 7.)</p>

<p>For details of conditional sentences, see <a href="#page-167">pp.&nbsp;167–172</a>.</p>

<p id="s-281"><b>281.</b> <b>Concession</b> or <b>condition</b> may be expressed by the <b>subjunctive</b>
without <i>though</i> or <i>if</i>, the verb preceding the subject, which is
sometimes omitted.</p>

<p class="title smcap">I. Concession</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Try</i> as we may, we cannot swim to that rock.</li>

  <li><i>Say</i> what he will, he can never convince me.</li>

  <li><i>Come</i> what will, I’ll stand my ground.</li>

  <li><i>Be</i> that as it may, my mind is made up.</li>
</ul>
<a id="page-122" href="#page-122" class="pagenum" title="122"></a>

<p class="title smcap">II. Condition</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Were</i> I asked, I could tell all the facts. [If I were asked, etc.]</li>

  <li><i>Had</i> I known, I would have written to you. [If I had known, etc.<!--TN: added period-->]</li>

  <li>I shall be twenty years old, <i>come</i> Tuesday. [If Tuesday come, etc.]</li>

  <li>I will go, <i>rain</i> or <i>shine</i>. [If it rain, or if it shine, etc.]</li>

  <li><i>Be</i> he prince or <i>be</i> he pauper, every guest is welcome here.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The subjunctive in these concessive and conditional uses is really
the same as that in exhortations (<a href="#s-278">§&nbsp;278</a>). “<i>Try</i> [<i>we</i>] as we may” means literally,
“<i>Let us try</i> as hard as we can,” and this has the force of “However
hard we try” or “<i>Although we try</i> ever so hard.”</p>

<p id="s-282"><b>282.</b> After <i>as if</i> (<i>as though</i>), the <b>past subjunctive</b> is used.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He looks as if he <i>were</i> about to speak. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: as if he <i>was</i> about to
  speak.]</li>

  <li>I act as if I <i>were</i> crazy. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: as if I <i>was</i> crazy.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-283"><b>283.</b> The <b>subjunctive</b> may express not what <b>is</b> or <b>was</b>, but
what <b>would be</b> or <b>would have been</b>, the case.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>It <i>were</i> safer to travel by day. [It would be safer, etc.]</li>

  <li>I <i>had been</i> wiser had I forded the river. [I should have been wiser if
  I had.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
This construction is old-fashioned. Modern English commonly uses <i>should</i>
(or <i>would</i>) <i>be</i>, <i>should</i> (or <i>would</i>) <i>have been</i>, instead.</p>

<p id="s-284"><b>284.</b> The <b>subjunctive</b> is occasionally used after <i>that</i>, <i>lest</i>, <i>before</i>,
<i>until</i>, etc., in subordinate clauses referring to the future
and commonly expressing <b>purpose</b> or <b>expectation</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Take heed that he <i>escape</i> not. [Purpose.]</li>
  <li>Give him food lest he <i>perish</i>. [Purpose.]</li>
  <li>Let us tarry until he <i>come</i>. [Expectation.]</li>
</ul>

<p>This construction is confined to poetry and the solemn or
formal style. In ordinary language the indicative or a verb-phrase
with <i>may</i> is used.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Take heed that he <i>does</i> not <i>escape</i>.</li>
  <li>Give him food in order that he <i>may</i> not <i>perish</i>.</li>
  <li>Let us wait till he <i>comes</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-285"><a id="page-123" href="#page-123" class="pagenum" title="123"></a>
<b>285.</b> The <b>past subjunctive</b> <i>had</i> is common in <i>had rather</i> and
similar phrases.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I <i>had rather</i> wait a day.</li>
  <li>You <i>had better</i> leave the room.</li>
  <li>He <i>had as lief</i> go as stay.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Had</i> in this construction is sometimes condemned as erroneous or
inelegant; but the idiom is well-established.</p>

<p><i>Might better</i>, <i>would better</i>, and <i>would rather</i> may be used instead of <i>had
better</i>, etc.; but <i>would better</i> is improper in the first person.</p>
</div>

<p id="s-286"><b>286.</b> The subjunctive forms are often replaced by verb-phrases
containing the auxiliaries <i>may</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>should</i>.</p>

<p id="s-286-1">1. In wishes (<a href="#s-277">§&nbsp;277</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>May</i> you <i>live</i> long and <i>prosper</i>!</li>
  <li><i>May</i> he never <i>repent</i> this act!</li>
  <li>Ah, <i>could</i> I but <i>live</i> a hundred years!</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-286-2">2. In concessions and conditions (<a href="#s-279">§§&nbsp;279–280</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Though {I | you | he} <i>should fail</i>, there would still be hope.</li>
  <li>If {I | you | he} <i>should fail</i>, all would be lost.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-286-3">3. In sentences expressing not what <b>is</b> or <b>was</b>, but what
<b>would be</b> or <b>would have been</b>, the case (<a href="#s-283">§&nbsp;283</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{I <i>should</i> | You <i>would</i> | He <i>would</i>}
  <i>write</i> to Charles if I knew his address.</li>
  <li>It <i>would have been</i> better to telegraph.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-286-4">4. In subordinate clauses introduced by <i>that</i>, <i>lest</i>, <i>before</i>,
<i>until</i>, etc. (<a href="#s-284">§&nbsp;284</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I will take care that nothing <i>may prevent</i>.</li>
  <li>I took care that nothing {<i>might</i> | <i>should</i>} <i>prevent</i>.</li>
  <li>The general determined to wait until fresh troops <i>should arrive</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>POTENTIAL VERB-PHRASES</h4>

<h5>USE OF MODAL AUXILIARIES</h5>

<p id="s-287"><b>287.</b> <b>Several auxiliary verbs are used to form verb-phrases indicating
ability, possibility, obligation, or necessity.</b></p>

<p>Such verb-phrases are called <b>potential phrases</b>, that is, “phrases
of possibility.”</p>

<p>The auxiliary verbs used in <b>potential phrases</b> are:—<i>may</i>, <i>can</i>,
<i>must</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, and <i>should</i>. They are called <b>modal
auxiliaries</b> and are followed by the infinitive without <i>to</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>We <i>may ask</i> him a few questions.</li>
  <li>I <i>can manage</i> a motor car.</li>
  <li>You <i>must inquire</i> the way.</li>
  <li>He <i>might give</i> you a chance.</li>
  <li>I <i>could show</i> you his house if you <i>would permit</i> me.</li>
  <li>I <i>should enjoy</i> a sea-voyage.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The fact that <i>give</i>, etc., in such phrases as <i>can give</i>, are infinitives
may be seen by comparing “I can <i>strike</i>” with “I am able <i>to strike</i>,” “I may
<i>strike</i>” with “I am permitted <i>to strike</i>,” “I must <i>strike</i>” with “I am obliged
<i>to strike</i>,” and so on. In earlier periods of the language, when the infinitive had
a special ending (<i>-an</i> or <i>-en</i>), the nature of the construction was unmistakable.</p>

<p id="s-288"><b>288.</b> <b>Potential phrases</b> may be arranged in tables of conjugation,
like that on <a href="#page-108">pp.&nbsp;108–110</a>. They are often called, collectively,
the <b>potential mood</b>.</p>

<p id="s-289"><b>289.</b> <i>Can</i> (past tense, <i>could</i>) regularly indicates that the

  <li>Harry <i>could</i> swim.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-290"><b>290.</b> <i>May</i> (past tense, <i>might</i>) indicates (1) <b>permission</b>, (2)

<p id="s-291"><a id="page-126" href="#page-126" class="pagenum" title="126"></a>
<b>291.</b> In asking permission, the proper form is “<i>May</i> I?”
not “<i>Can</i> I?” With negatives, however, <i>can</i> is more common
than <i>may</i>, except in questions. Thus,—</p>

<h4>SPECIAL RULES FOR <i>SHOULD</i> AND <i>WOULD</i></h4>

<p id="s-296"><b>296.</b> <i>Should</i> is the past tense of <i>shall</i>, and <i>would</i> is the past
tense of <i>will</i>. Hence the rules for <i>should</i> and <i>would</i> are similar
to those for <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> (<a href="#s-233">§§&nbsp;233–239</a>). But there is much
variation, especially in subordinate clauses.</p>

distinction between <i>should</i> and <i>would</i> is practically the same

of <b>wishing</b>, <b>consenting</b>, or the like, the forms are as follows:—</p>

<p id="s-298"><a id="page-128" href="#page-128" class="pagenum" title="128"></a>
<b>298.</b> Common errors are the use of <i>I would</i> for <i>I should</i> in
assertions, and that of <i>Would I?</i> and <i>Would you?</i> for <i>Should
I?</i> and <i>Should you?</i> in questions.</p>

<p>The correct forms are shown in the following sentences.</p>

<p>I. <i>I should</i> (<i>we should</i>) and <i>I would</i> (<i>we would</i>) in <b>assertions</b>:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="item">1.</span> <i>I should</i> break my neck if I fell.</li>
  <li><span class="item">2.</span> <i>I should</i> hesitate to try this experiment.</li>
  <li><span class="item">3.</span> <i>I should</i>n’t wonder if he escaped.</li>
  <li><span class="item">4.</span> <i>We should</i> regret any misunderstanding.</li>
  <li><span class="item">5.</span> <i>I should</i> wish to examine the plans again before deciding.</li>
  <li><span class="item">6.</span> <i>I should</i> be glad to accept any fair offer.</li>
  <li><span class="item">7.</span> <i>I would</i> give five dollars for a ticket.</li>
  <li><span class="item">8.</span> <i>I would</i> help you if I could.</li>
  <li><span class="item">9.</span> <i>I would</i> never agree to such a proposition.</li>
  <li><span class="item">10.</span> <i>We would</i> rather die than surrender.</li>
  <li><span class="item">11.</span> <i>We would</i> pay our bill to-day if we had the money.</li>
  <li><span class="item">12.</span> <i>I would</i> gladly accept any fair offer.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first six examples, <i>I</i> (or <i>we</i>) <i>should</i> is correct, because
the auxiliary gives no suggestion of the speaker’s will (or
volition). In the last six, on the contrary, the speaker’s willingness
or desire is plainly expressed by the auxiliary, and <i>I</i>
(or <i>we</i>) <i>would</i> is therefore used.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In such sentences as the fifth,—“I should wish to examine the plans
again before deciding,”—<i>wish</i> expresses volition. Hence “I <i>would</i> wish” is
incorrect, for it expresses volition twice and can mean only “I desire to wish.”
On the same principle we say “I should prefer,” “I should be glad,” etc.
(see <a href="#s-236">§&nbsp;236</a>).</p>

<p>Sometimes either <i>I would</i> or <i>I should</i> may be used, but with a difference in
meaning. Thus, in the eighth example, “I should help you” might be substituted
for “I would help you.” This change, however, makes the remark sound
less cordial and sympathetic; for <i>I should</i> (unlike <i>I would</i>) gives no hint of
the speaker’s desire to be of service.</p>
</div>

<p>II. <i>Should I</i> (or <i>we</i>)? in <b>questions</b>:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. <i>Should I</i> break my neck if I fell?</li>
  <li>2. <i>Should I</i> be poisoned if I ate those berries?</li>
  <li>3. <i>Should I</i> take cold without my overcoat?</li>
  <li>4. <i>Should I</i> disturb you if I were to practise my music lesson?</li>
  <li>5. <i>Should we</i> run aground if we missed the channel?</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><a id="page-129" href="#page-129" class="pagenum" title="129"></a>
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Would I?</i> is confined, for the most part, to questions in which one
repeats the words or thought of another. Thus,—“<i>You would</i> give five dollars
for a ticket.” “<i>Would I?</i> No, I wouldn’t!” In this use it is chiefly colloquial.</p>

<p>III. <i>Should you?</i> and <i>Would you?</i> in questions:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="item">1.</span> <i>Should you</i> drown if the boat were to capsize? [Yes, <i>I should</i>
  drown, for I do not know how to swim.]</li>

  <li><span class="item">2.</span> <i>Should you</i> despair if this plan were a failure? [No, <i>I should</i> not,
  for I have other resources.]</li>

  <li><span class="item">3.</span> <i>Should you</i> think that ten yards of velvet would be enough? [Yes,
  <i>I should</i> think so.]</li>

  <li><span class="item">4.</span> <i>Should you</i> be offended if I were to speak frankly? [No, <i>I should</i>
  not be offended.]</li>

  <li><span class="item">5.</span> <i>Should you</i> wish to examine the plans again before deciding?
  [Yes, <i>I should</i> (see note under I, above).]</li>

  <li><span class="item">6.</span> <i>Would you</i> wear a hat or a cap? [<i>I would</i> wear a cap if I were you.]</li>

  <li><span class="item">7.</span> <i>Would you</i> study Greek if you were in my place? [Yes, <i>I would</i>.]</li>

  <li><span class="item">8.</span> <i>Would you</i> accept my apology if it were offered? [Certainly, <i>I
  would</i> accept it gladly.]</li>

  <li><span class="item">9.</span> <i>Would you</i> be so kind as to lend me your compasses? [Certainly
  <i>I would</i> lend them, if I had not lost them.]</li>

  <li><span class="item">10.</span> <i>Would you</i> allow me to use your name as a reference? [<i>I would.</i>]</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice between <i>should</i> and <i>would</i> in these sentences
corresponds to the form expected in the answer (<a href="#s-238">§&nbsp;238</a>).</p>

<p id="s-299"><b>299.</b> The chief occasions on which <i>Would you?</i> is correct
are:—(1) in <b>asking advice</b> in a matter of doubt, and (2) in
<b>asking consent</b> or <b>permission</b>.</p>

<p class="note">
In examples 6 and 7 in <a href="#s-298">§&nbsp;298</a>, III, the speaker asks advice; in 8, 9,
and 10, he asks consent or permission.</p>

<p id="s-300"><b>300.</b> Note that the proper forms are <i>I should like</i>, <i>Should I
like?</i> and <i>Should you like?</i></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>I should</i> like to read that book.</li>

  <li><i>Should I</i> like to go to Rome? Indeed, <i>I should</i>.</li>

  <li><i>Should you</i> like to receive a copy of our catalogue? [<i>I should</i> like to
  receive one.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Would</i> is very common in these phrases, even among writers of
repute, but it is still contrary to the best usage. The reason for <i>should</i> is the
same as in <i>I should wish</i> (<a href="#s-298">§&nbsp;298</a>, I, note).</p>

<p id="s-301"><a id="page-130" href="#page-130" class="pagenum" title="130"></a>
<b>301.</b> <i>I’d</i> and <i>we’d</i> are contractions of <i>I would</i> and <i>we
would</i>. Hence they can never stand for <i>I should</i> and <i>we
should</i> (<a href="#s-235">§&nbsp;235</a>).</p>

<p id="s-302"><b>302.</b> <i>Should</i> in the <b>second</b> and <b>third persons</b> may be used in
simple declarative sentences and independent clauses to express
the will of the speaker (<a href="#s-239">§&nbsp;239</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>If I had my way, <i>you should</i> be prosecuted. [That is: I would take
  care that you were prosecuted.]</li>

  <li>If I had the money, <i>you should</i> be paid immediately. [Compare: <i>You
  shall</i> be paid.]</li>

  <li>If I were you, <i>she should</i> not regret her generosity. [Compare: <i>She
  shall</i> not regret it.]</li>
</ul>

<h5>II. <i>SHOULD</i> AND <i>WOULD</i> IN SUBORDINATE CLAUSES</h5>

<p id="s-303"><b>303.</b> In some kinds of <b>subordinate clauses</b>, the use of <i>should</i>
and <i>would</i> differs considerably from that in simple sentences
and principal clauses.</p>

<p>The following classes require attention:—(1) clauses of purpose
or expectation (<a href="#s-304">§&nbsp;304</a>), (2) conditional and concessive
clauses (<a href="#s-305">§&nbsp;305</a>), (3) clauses expressing volition not that of
the subject (<a href="#s-306">§&nbsp;306</a>), (4) clauses stating something as an idea
(<a href="#s-307">§&nbsp;307</a>), (5) indirect discourse (<a href="#s-308">§&nbsp;308</a>).</p>

<p id="s-304"><b>304.</b> In subordinate clauses expressing the <b>purpose</b> or <b>expectation</b>
with which anything is done, <i>shall</i> and <i>should</i> are used
in all three persons.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Charleton took great pains that {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>they</i>} <i>should</i> understand the details of the treaty.</li>
  <li>Scott {<i>is</i> | <i>was</i>} very careful that <i>nothing</i> {<i>shall</i> | <i>should</i>} interfere with his plans.</li>
  <li>They took every precaution lest {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>he</i>} <i>should</i> suspect the plot.</li>
  <li>Anderson waited patiently until {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>they</i>} <i>should</i> arrive with the horses.</li>
  <li>We strained every nerve to reach the cave before the <i>storm should</i> break.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-305"><a id="page-131" href="#page-131" class="pagenum" title="131"></a>
<b>305.</b> In <b>conditional</b> or <b>concessive</b> clauses expressing a <b>future
supposed case</b> doubtfully, <i>shall</i> and <i>should</i> are used in <b>all three
persons</b>; but <i>will</i> and <i>would</i> are proper when the subject is
thought of as <b>wishing</b> or <b>consenting</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="item">1.</span> What would happen if {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>he</i>} <i>should</i> not carry out the commander’s instructions?</li>
  <li><span class="item">2.</span> If {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>he</i>} <i>should</i> miss the steamer, our friends would be alarmed.</li>
  <li><span class="item">3.</span> <i>Whoever</i> {<i>shall</i> | <i>should</i>} violate this law {shall | should} pay the penalty. [That is: If anybody shall violate, etc.]</li>
  <li><span class="item">4.</span> Whenever {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>he</i>} <i>shall</i> find an opportunity, let us try the experiment. [That is: If ever I shall find, etc.]</li>
  <li><span class="item">5.</span> He promised to assist you whenever <i>you should</i> need help. [Whenever = if ever.]</li>
  <li><span class="item">6.</span> Though {<i>we</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>they</i>} <i>should</i> fail, others would make the attempt. [Concession.]</li>
  <li><span class="item">7.</span> Though <i>Evans should</i> disappoint me, I should not lose confidence in him.</li>
  <li><span class="item">8.</span> Vernon will do his part if {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>they</i>} <i>will</i> coöperate with him.</li>
  <li><span class="item">9.</span> If {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>he</i>} <i>will</i> only make the effort, success is certain.</li>
  <li><span class="item">10.</span> Edmund would reveal the secret if {<i>I</i> | <i>you</i> | <i>they</i>} <i>would</i> assist him in his search for the treasure.</li>
  <li><span class="item">11.</span> If <i>we would</i> take pains, our parents would be satisfied.</li>
  <li><span class="item">12.</span> <i>Whoever will</i> join us may be sure of a pleasant and profitable journey. [That is: If any one will join us, he may be sure, etc.]</li>
</ul>

<p>When a <b>future supposed case</b> is admitted or conceded as <b>certain</b>,
<i>will</i> may be used in the second and third persons to denote
mere futurity.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Though {<i>you</i> | <i>he</i>} <i>will</i> certainly fail, {you | he} may make the attempt.</li>
  <li>Though the <i>ship will</i> not sink for some hours, let us take to the boats.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-306"><a id="page-132" href="#page-132" class="pagenum" title="132"></a>
<b>306.</b> <i>Shall</i> and <i>should</i> are often used in the second and third
persons in subordinate clauses to express volition which is not
that of the subject.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Templeton insists that <i>you shall</i> accompany him.</li>
  <li>This letter directs where <i>you shall</i> station yourself.</li>
  <li>We gave orders that the <i>gates should</i> be closed.</li>
  <li>My wish is that {<i>you</i> | <i>he</i>} <i>should</i> remain at home.</li>
  <li>The law prescribed when and to whom the <i>tax should</i> be paid.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-307"><b>307.</b> When a clause with <i>that</i> states something, not as a
<b>fact</b> but as an <b>idea</b> to be considered, <i>should</i> is the proper
auxiliary in all three persons.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I am not surprised that you <i>should</i> find your lesson rather difficult.
  [That is: “When I consider the matter, I do not find the idea surprising.”
  In “I am not surprised <i>that you find</i>,” etc., the subordinate clause makes
  the statement <b>as a fact</b>.]</li>

  <li>It is strange that Tom <i>should</i> neglect his swimming lessons. [Contrast:
  It is strange that Tom <i>neglects</i>.]</li>

  <li>That Napoleon <i>should</i> have chafed at captivity is only natural. [Contrast:
  That Napoleon <i>chafed</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-308"><b>308.</b> For <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>, <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>, in <b>indirect discourse</b>,
see <a href="#s-438">§§&nbsp;438–439</a>.</p>

<h4>THE INFINITIVE</h4>

<p id="s-309"><b>309.</b> The <b>infinitive</b> is a <b>verb-form</b> that has some of the properties
of a <b>noun</b> (<a href="#s-28">§&nbsp;28</a>). Its two-sided character comes out clearly
when it is used as the subject of a sentence.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. <i>To hope</i> is our only resource.</li>
  <li>2. <i>To flatter</i> is not my custom.</li>
  <li>3. <i>To sleep</i> was an impossibility.</li>
  <li>4. <i>To surrender</i> seemed disgraceful.</li>
  <li>5. <i>To choose</i> wisely was my greatest difficulty.</li>
  <li>6. <i>To scale</i> the wall was the work of a moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these infinitives (<i>to hope</i>, <i>to flatter</i>, etc.) is a <b>noun</b>,
for each is the simple subject of a sentence. Besides, an ordinary
noun may be substituted for each infinitive with no change
<a id="page-133" href="#page-133" class="pagenum" title="133"></a>
in meaning; as,—“<i>Hope</i> is our only resource”; “<i>Flattery</i> is
not my custom”; “<i>Sleep</i> was an impossibility.”</p>

<p>But each of these infinitives is also a <b>verb</b>,—for (1) it expresses
action; (2) it may be modified by an adverb, as in
No. 5; (3) it takes an object if it is transitive, as in No. 6.</p>

<p>An infinitive (as the examples show) has regularly no subject
and therefore lacks both number and person. Hence it is not
bound by the general rule for the agreement of a verb with
its subject (<a href="#s-222">§&nbsp;222</a>). From this fact it derives its name, <b>infinitive</b>,
which means “unrestricted” or “free from limitations.”<a href="#footnote-38" id="marker-38" class="marker" title="Footnote 38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p id="s-310"><b>310.</b> <b>The infinitive is a verb-form which partakes of the nature of a
noun. It expresses action or state in the simplest possible way, without
person or number.</b></p>

<p><b>It is commonly preceded by the preposition <i>to</i>, which is called the
sign of the infinitive.</b></p>

<p><i>To</i> is not, in strictness, a part of the infinitive, but it may
be so regarded for convenience, since the infinitive, in most of
its uses, is preceded by <i>to</i>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>To</i> sometimes stands for an infinitive in careless speech: as,—“You
may go if you wish <i>to</i>” (that is, “if you wish <i>to go</i>”). Such expressions
are to be avoided. It is better to say, “You may go if you wish.”</p>

<p id="s-311"><b>311.</b> The infinitive often lacks <i>to</i>, especially in verb-phrases
with the auxiliaries <i>will</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>,
<i>would</i>, <i>should</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>did</i>. For examples, see <a href="#page-102">pp.&nbsp;102</a>, <a href="#page-114">114</a>, <a href="#page-124">124</a>.</p>

<p id="s-312"><b>312.</b> The infinitive has two tenses,—the <b>present</b> and the
<b>perfect</b>.</p>

<p>1. The <b>present infinitive</b> is the verb in its simplest form, usually
preceded by <i>to</i>: as,—<i>to live</i>, <i>to teach</i>, <i>to bind</i>, <i>to strike</i>.</p>

<p>2. The <b>perfect infinitive</b> is made by prefixing the infinitive of
the auxiliary verb <i>have</i> to the past participle (<a href="#s-243">§&nbsp;243</a>): as,—<i>to
have lived</i>, <i>to have taught</i>, <i>to have bound</i>, <i>to have struck</i>.</p>

<p id="s-313"><a id="page-134" href="#page-134" class="pagenum" title="134"></a>
<b>313.</b> An infinitive may be modified by an <b>adverb</b>, an <b>adverbial
phrase</b>, or an <b>adverbial clause</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>To write <i>legibly</i> is a valuable accomplishment.</li>
  <li>It would be useless to search <i>longer</i>.</li>
  <li>They allowed him to go <i>in peace</i>. [Adverbial phrase.]</li>
  <li>To dive <i>among those weeds</i> would be folly.</li>
  <li>Theodore promises to come <i>when I send for him</i>. [Adverbial clause.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>No modifier should be inserted between <i>to</i> and the infinitive.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I beg you to inquire carefully into this matter. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: to carefully
  inquire.]</li>

  <li>Mr. Harris moved to postpone the question indefinitely. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: to
  indefinitely postpone.]</li>

  <li>I expect always to be poor. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: to always be poor.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Careless writers pay slight attention to this rule, and some good
writers and speakers defy it, hoping to break it down. But it is unquestionably
still in accord with the best usage.</p>

<p id="s-314"><b>314.</b> <b>The infinitive may take an object if its meaning allows.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I long to visit <i>Italy</i>.</li>

  <li>My mother feared to enter the <i>house</i>.</li>

  <li>To launch a <i>boat</i> was impossible.</li>

  <li>To grant your <i>request</i> is a pleasure.</li>

  <li>To give <i>him money</i> is useless. [<i>Money</i> is the direct object of <i>to give</i>,
  and <i>him</i> the indirect object.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-315"><b>315.</b> The infinitive is used in a variety of constructions,—(1)
as a <b>noun</b>, (2) as an <b>adjective modifier</b> or <b>adverbial modifier</b>,
(3) in the so-called <b>infinitive clause</b>.</p>

<h5>I. THE INFINITIVE AS NOUN</h5>

<p id="s-316"><b>316.</b> The infinitive is used in various <b>noun constructions</b>,—as
subject, as predicate nominative, as nominative of exclamation,
as appositive, as object of certain prepositions, as modifier.</p>

<p id="s-317"><b>317.</b> <b>An infinitive with or without a complement or modifiers, may
be used as the subject of a sentence, as a predicate nominative, or as
an appositive.</b></p>
<a id="page-135" href="#page-135" class="pagenum" title="135"></a>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>To descend</i> was extremely difficult. [Subject.]</li>

  <li><i>To secure</i> a seat was impossible.</li>

  <li><i>To sing</i> well requires practice.</li>

  <li>His delight was <i>to travel</i>. [Predicate nominative.]</li>

  <li>The governor’s policy is <i>to wait</i>.</li>

  <li>My wish is <i>to see</i> you immediately.</li>

  <li><i>To decide</i> was <i>to act</i>. [The first infinitive is the subject, and the second

  <li>Both alternatives, <i>to advance</i> and <i>to retreat</i>, seemed equally hazardous.

  <li>My first plan, <i>to tunnel</i> under the wall, proved a failure.</li>

  <li>He has but one aim in life, <i>to succeed</i>. [Apposition with the object.]</li>

  <li>I have written with a definite purpose, <i>to dissuade</i> you.</li>

  <li>I give you three choices,—<i>to buy</i>, <i>to lease</i>, or <i>to build</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-318"><b>318.</b> An infinitive in the predicate is often in apposition
with the expletive subject <i>it</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>It was a pleasure <i>to see</i> him. [Instead of: To see him was a pleasure.]</li>
  <li>It is easy <i>to understand</i> you.</li>
  <li>It will be impossible <i>to forget</i>.</li>
  <li>It proved very difficult <i>to find</i> evidence against him.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
In this use the infinitive, though grammatically in apposition with <i>it</i>, is
really the subject of the thought (see <a href="#s-120-2">§&nbsp;120, 2</a>).</p>

<p id="s-319"><b>319.</b> The infinitive may be used as the <b>object</b> of the prepositions
<i>but</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>about</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>There was nothing to do but <i>walk</i> (or <i>to walk</i>).</li>
  <li>He will do anything except <i>resign</i> (or except <i>to resign</i>).</li>
  <li>We are about <i>to object</i>. [An idiom expressing futurity.]</li>
  <li>The train is about <i>to start</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Can but</i> and <i>cannot but</i> are distinct idioms. (1) In “I <i>can but</i> thank
you,” <i>but</i> is an adverb (= <i>only</i>). The sentence means: “I can <i>only</i> thank
you—simply that and nothing more!” (2) In “I <i>cannot but</i> thank you,”
<i>but</i> is a preposition (= <i>except</i>). The idiom is shortened from “I cannot
<i>choose but</i> thank you,”—that is, “I have <i>no choice except</i> to do so,” or, in
other words, “I cannot help it.”</p>

<p>The infinitive after <i>for</i> (now a gross error) was once in good use: as,—</p>

<h5>II. THE INFINITIVE AS A MODIFIER</h5>

<p id="s-321"><b>321.</b> <b>An infinitive may be used as an adjective modifier of a noun or
as an adverbial modifier of an adjective.</b></p>

<p><b>In this use the infinitive is said to depend on the word which it
modifies.</b></p>

    <td>He is anxious <i>to please</i> everybody.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This use is due to the fact that the infinitive with <i>to</i> is really a
prepositional phrase (<a href="#s-42">§&nbsp;42</a>). Thus, “determination <i>to win</i>” is equivalent to
“determination for victory,” and “eager <i>to win</i>” to “eager <i>for victory</i>.”
The adjective force of the infinitive comes out clearly in “nothing <i>to eat</i>,”
where <i>to eat</i> is practically synonymous with <i>eatable</i>.</p>

<p>In its adjective use, the present infinitive sometimes shows no distinction
in voice, so that the active and the passive are interchangeable: as,—“a
house <i>to let</i>” or “<i>to be let</i>”; “an axe <i>to grind</i>” or “<i>to be ground</i>.” In such
expressions the active form is usually preferable.</p>
</div>

<p id="s-322"><b>322.</b> The infinitive without <i>to</i> may be used as an adjective
modifier after the direct object of <i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>, <i>feel</i>, and some
other verbs of like meaning.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I saw the policeman <i>arrest</i> him.</li>
  <li>Hear the sea <i>roar</i>!</li>
  <li>Can you feel the ground <i>tremble</i>?</li>
  <li>Ruth watched the tide <i>come</i> in.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
In this use the infinitive is practically equivalent to a participle. Compare
“I heard him <i>shout</i>” with “I heard him <i>shouting</i>.” Hence the substantive
may be regarded as an object, and the infinitive as its modifier. But the
construction closely approaches that of an infinitive clause (<a href="#s-324">§§&nbsp;324–325</a>).</p>

<p id="s-323"><a id="page-137" href="#page-137" class="pagenum" title="137"></a>
<b>323.</b> <b>An infinitive may modify a verb (1) by completing its meaning,
or (2) by expressing the purpose of the action.</b></p>

<h6>I. Complementary Infinitive</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The ship began <i>to roll</i>.</li>
  <li>The rain continued <i>to fall</i> heavily.</li>
  <li>Every boy desires <i>to succeed</i>.</li>
  <li>The officer neglected <i>to watch</i> his men.</li>
  <li>The prisoners attempted <i>to escape</i>.</li>
  <li>You promised <i>to come</i> to-night.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
After <i>dare</i>, the complementary infinitive may or may not have <i>to</i>. Thus,—“I
dare not <i>do</i> it”; “Who will dare <i>to speak</i>?”</p>

<h6>II. Infinitive of Purpose</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He went to New York <i>to study</i> medicine.</li>
  <li>He opened his lips <i>to speak</i>.</li>
  <li>She closed her eyes <i>to shut</i> out the sight.</li>
  <li>Elsa lifted the cover <i>to see</i> what was inside.</li>
  <li>The conductor signalled <i>to stop</i> the train.</li>
  <li>Harold waited <i>to assist</i> his teacher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the <b>complementary infinitive</b> and the <b>infinitive of purpose</b>
may be regarded as <b>adverbial phrases</b> modifying the verb.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> After some verbs the infinitive approaches the construction of a
pure noun and is often regarded as an object. Thus,—“I desire <i>to see</i> you”
(compare “I desire a <i>sight</i> of you”). It is simpler, however, to regard all
such infinitives as complementary and to treat them as adverbial modifiers.
For it is impossible to distinguish the construction of the infinitive after certain
adjectives (as in “I am eager <i>to see</i> you”) from its construction after
such verbs as <i>wish</i> and <i>desire</i>.</p>

<h5>III. THE INFINITIVE CLAUSE</h5>

<p id="s-324"><b>324.</b> A peculiar infinitive construction often replaces a <i>that</i>-clause
as the object of a verb. Thus,—</p>

<p class="example">I wished {<i>that he should go</i>. | <i>him to go</i>.}</p>

<p>In the first sentence, the noun clause <i>that he should go</i> is the
object of <i>wished</i>; in the second, this clause is replaced by <i>him to
<a id="page-138" href="#page-138" class="pagenum" title="138"></a>
go</i>, but without any change in meaning. This expression consists
of two parts:—(1) <i>him</i>, a pronoun in the objective case,
which replaces the subject <i>he</i>; and (2) an infinitive <i>to go</i>,
which replaces the predicate <i>should go</i>. Thus it is plain that
<i>him to go</i> is also a noun clause, of which <i>him</i> is the subject,
and <i>to go</i> the predicate. Such an expression is called an
<b>infinitive clause</b>.</p>

<p id="s-325"><b>325.</b> <b>A kind of clause, consisting of a substantive in the objective
case followed by an infinitive, may be used as the object of certain
verbs.</b></p>

<p><b>Such clauses are called infinitive clauses, and the substantive is said
to be the subject of the infinitive.</b></p>

<p><b>The subject of an infinitive is in the objective case.</b></p>

<p><b>Infinitive clauses</b> are used (1) after verbs of <i>wishing</i>, <i>commanding</i>,
<i>advising</i>, and the like, and (2) after some verbs of <i>believing</i>,
<i>declaring</i>, and <i>perceiving</i>.<a href="#footnote-39" id="marker-39" class="marker" title="Footnote 39"><sup>39</sup></a> Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The colonel commanded <i>them to charge</i> [= that they should charge].</li>
  <li>I believe <i>him to be trustworthy</i> [= that he is trustworthy].</li>
  <li>The judge declared <i>him to be a dangerous man</i> [= that he was, etc.].</li>
</ul>

<p>After a few verbs the infinitive without <i>to</i> is used in infinitive
clauses.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Mr. Esmond bade his servant <i>pack</i> a portmanteau and <i>get</i> horses.
  [Compare: ordered his servant <i>to pack</i>, etc.]</li>

  <li>What makes him <i>cry</i>? [Compare: What causes him <i>to cry</i>?]</li>

  <li>I let him <i>sleep</i>. [Compare: I allowed him <i>to sleep</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Ordinarily the infinitive cannot assert and hence has no subject
(<a href="#s-309">§&nbsp;309</a>). The infinitive clause is, therefore, a peculiar exception, for <i>him to go</i>
makes an assertion as clearly as <i>that he should go</i> does. That <i>him</i> is really
the subject of <i>to go</i> and not the object of <i>wished</i> is manifest, for <i>I wished
him</i> makes no sense. The object of <i>wished</i> is the whole clause (<i>him to go</i>).</p>

<p>Originally, to be sure, the noun or pronoun in the objective was felt to be
the object of the main verb, and this relation may still be felt in “I ordered
him to go”; but even here the real object of <i>ordered</i> is the clause (as may be
seen in “I ordered the castle to be blown up”). The substantive has come to
be the real subject of the infinitive, and should be so treated in parsing.</p>

<b>326.</b> A <b>predicate pronoun</b> after <i>to be</i> in an infinitive clause is

<h4>PARTICIPLES</h4>

<p id="s-329"><b>329.</b> Certain words unite in themselves some of the properties
of <b>adjectives</b> with some of the properties of <b>verbs</b>. Such
words are called <b>participles</b> (<a href="#s-31">§&nbsp;31</a>). Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>Shattered</i> and <i>sinking</i>, but gallantly <i>returning</i> the enemy’s fire, the
frigate drifted out to sea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Shattered</i>, <i>sinking</i>, and <i>returning</i> are verb-forms which are in
some respects similar to infinitives: for (1) they express action;
(2) they have no subject to agree with, and hence have neither
person nor number; and (3) one of them takes a direct object.
They differ from infinitives, however, in that they resemble,
not nouns, but adjectives, for they describe the substantive
<i>frigate</i> to which they belong.</p>

<p>Such verb-forms are called <b>participles</b>, because they share (or
participate in) the nature of adjectives.</p>

<p id="s-330"><b>330.</b> <b>The participle is a verb-form which has no subject, but which
partakes of the nature of an adjective and expresses action or state in
such a way as to describe or limit a substantive.</b></p>

  <li>Who <i>thundering</i> comes on blackest steed?<span class="attribution">—Byron.</span></li>

  <li><i>Clinging</i> to the horns of the altar, voiceless she stood.<span class="attribution">—De Quincey.</span></li>

  in clear azure splendor, <i>enlightening</i> the world.<span class="attribution">—Carlyle.</span></li>

<h5>FORMS OF PARTICIPLES</h5>

<p id="s-331"><b>331.</b> Verbs have three participles,—the <b>present</b>, the <b>past</b>,
and the <b>perfect</b>.</p>

<p id="s-332"><b>332.</b> The <b>present participle</b> ends in <i>-ing</i>. It usually describes
an action as taking place at the same time with some other
action.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Tom came <i>sauntering</i> up the path.</li>
  <li>The beggar shambled down the steps, <i>grumbling</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Reaching</i> for the flower, I lost my balance.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-333"><a id="page-141" href="#page-141" class="pagenum" title="141"></a>
<b>333.</b> The present participle often refers to time preceding
that denoted by the predicate verb.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Rising</i> from his chair, he bowed. [That is, when he had risen.]</li>

  <li><i>Learning</i> that your brother was in trouble, I hastened to his aid.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-334"><b>334.</b> <b>The past participle is always associated with the idea of past
time or completed action.</b></p>

<h5>CONSTRUCTIONS OF PARTICIPLES</h5>

<p id="s-337"><b>337.</b> Since the participle has adjective properties, its constructions
are in the main like those of adjectives.</p>

<p id="s-338"><b>338.</b> <b>A participle is said to belong to the substantive which it
describes or limits.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Rupert, <i>missing</i> his companion, stepped to the door. [The present
  participle <i>missing</i> belongs to the subject <i>Rupert</i>.]</li>

  <li><i>Rising</i>, she opened the window. [<i>Rising</i> belongs to <i>she</i>.]</li>

  <li>I heard the rain <i>falling</i>. [<i>Falling</i> belongs to the object <i>rain</i>.]</li>

  <li>Tom’s arm, <i>broken</i> by the blow, hung useless. [The past participle
  <i>broken</i> belongs to the subject <i>arm</i>.]</li>

  <li><i>Having climbed</i> the hill with great difficulty, I stopped to rest. [The
  perfect participle <i>having climbed</i> belongs to the subject <i>I</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-339"><b>339.</b> <b>A participle should not be used without some substantive to
which it may belong.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Right</span>: <i>Entering</i> the room, we saw a strange sight. [The participle
  <i>entering</i> belongs to the pronoun <i>we</i>.]</li>

  <li><span class="smcap">Wrong</span>: <i>Entering</i> the room, a strange sight was seen. [Since there is
  no substantive to which <i>entering</i> can belong, it has no construction.]</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparent exceptions are <i>concerning</i>, <i>considering</i>, <i>pending</i>,
<i>generally speaking</i>, etc. The first three may be classed as prepositions
(<a href="#s-355">§&nbsp;355</a>), the last as an independent participle.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>We fought every day, and, <i>generally speaking</i>, twice every day.<span class="attribution">—De
Quincey.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The rule in <a href="#s-339">§&nbsp;339</a> does not apply to such phrases as <i>on entering</i>,
<i>after investigating</i>, etc., in which the words in <i>-ing</i> are not participles, but
verbal nouns (<a href="#s-348">§&nbsp;348</a>). Thus the following sentences are grammatical:—“<i>On
entering</i> the room, a strange sight appeared”; “<i>After investigating</i> the subject,
the plan was adopted.” Such expressions, however, should be used with
caution, since they are sometimes awkward or ambiguous.</p>

<p id="s-340"><b>340.</b> <b>A participle may be modified by an adverb, an adverbial
phrase, or an adverbial clause.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Smiling <i>brightly</i>, she extended her hand. [Adverb.]</li>
  <li>He leaped forward, shrieking <i>with all his might</i>. [Adverbial phrase.]</li>
  <li>Laughing <i>until he cried</i>, he sank into a chair. [Adverbial clause.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-341"><a id="page-143" href="#page-143" class="pagenum" title="143"></a>
<b>341.</b> <b>A participle may take an object if its meaning allows.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I found the old man mending his <i>net</i>.</li>

  <li>Lifting the <i>box</i>, he moved toward the door.</li>

  <li>Giving <i>me</i> a friendly <i>nod</i>, he passed on. [Here <i>nod</i> is the direct object
  of <i>giving</i>, and <i>me</i> is the indirect object.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
The participle, with its modifiers and such other words as are attached to
it, is sometimes called a <b>participial phrase</b>.</p>

<p id="s-342"><b>342.</b> A participle may be used as a pure adjective.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>A <i>grinning</i> boy confronted me.</li>
  <li>A <i>battered</i> hat hung on the peg.</li>
  <li>Kate was playing with a <i>broken</i> doll.</li>
  <li>We could hear a <i>rushing</i> stream.</li>
  <li><i>Willing</i> hands make light work.</li>
  <li>He was struck by a <i>spent</i> ball.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-343"><b>343.</b> The past participle is often used as a <b>predicate adjective</b>
expressing state or condition.</p>

<p>This construction is easily confused with the passive of verbs.
The distinction may be seen in the following examples:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The rain began to fall heavily, and every time a gust of wind struck
  us we <i>were drenched</i> by it.</li>

  <li>When the rain at last ceased, we were <i>drenched</i> [that is, <i>very wet</i>].</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, <i>were drenched</i> is the past passive of
the verb <i>drench</i> (compare the active “every time a gust of
wind struck us, it <i>drenched</i> us”). In the second, the participle
<i>drenched</i> expresses mere condition, and is therefore a predicate
adjective. The distinction, however, is not always sharp,
and in cases of doubt the phrase may be taken together as a
passive verb.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The real test is the following. Whenever a person or thing is distinctly
present to the mind as the doer of the action, we have a passive verb-phrase.
Whenever, on the other hand, the participle merely describes condition
with no thought of its being the result of an antecedent act, the construction
is that of a predicate adjective (<a href="#s-172-3">§&nbsp;172, 3</a>).</p>

<h6>Nominative Absolute</h6>

<p id="s-344"><b>344.</b> A substantive, with the participle belonging to it, is
often used to make a peculiar form of adverbial modifying
phrase: as,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>The wind failing</i>, we lowered the sail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here <i>the wind failing</i> is equivalent to an adverbial phrase (<i>on
the failure of the wind</i>) or an adverbial clause (<i>when the wind
failed</i>). It defines the time of the action.</p>

<p class="example"> {<i>The wind failing</i>, | <i>On the failure of the wind</i>, | <i>When the wind failed</i>,} we lowered the sail.</p>

<p id="s-345"><b>345.</b> <b>A substantive, with a participle, may express the cause, time,
or circumstances of an action.</b></p>

<p><b>This is called the absolute construction.</b></p>

<p><b>The substantive is in the nominative case and is called a nominative
absolute.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>My knife slipping</i>, I cut myself severely. [The phrase <i>my knife slipping</i>
  is equivalent to <i>because my knife slipped</i>: it expresses <b>cause</b>.]</li>

  <li><i>Two days having elapsed</i>, we again set forward. [The phrase in italics
  is equivalent to <i>when two days had elapsed</i>: it expresses <b>time</b>.]</li>

  <li>Evenings he read aloud, <i>his wife sewing by his side</i>. [The phrase expresses
  one of the <b>circumstances</b> that attended the reading.]</li>

  <li><i>This done</i>, proceed to business. [The phrase <i>this done</i> is equivalent to
  the clause <i>since</i> (or <i>when</i>) <i>this is done</i>, and indicates <b>cause</b> or <b>time</b>.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This construction is called <b>absolute</b> (that is, “free” or “loosened”)
because the substantive is not in any one of the constructions (subject, object,
apposition, etc.) which ordinarily attach nouns grammatically to other words
in the sentence. Nevertheless, the whole phrase, though standing apart from
the rest of the sentence, is in meaning an adverbial modifier of some verb.</p>

<p id="s-346"><b>346.</b> The participle <i>being</i> is sometimes omitted in the absolute
construction.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Allen once mayor, my chance of advancement would be ruined. [That
  is: <i>Allen</i> once <i>being mayor</i>.]</li>

  <li>Peter stood before me, his hands in his pockets.</li>

  <li>His clothing in shreds, he presented a sorry sight.</li>
</ul>

<h4>VERBAL NOUNS IN <i>-ING</i> (PARTICIPIAL NOUNS)</h4>

<p id="s-347"><b>347.</b> English has a large and important class of <b>verbal nouns</b>
that end in <i>-ing</i>, and that serve as the <b>names of actions</b>.</p>

<p>These are identical in form with <b>present participles</b>, for which
they are frequently mistaken. The distinction, however, is clear,
for the present participle is never used as the name of an action.
Hence no such word in <i>-ing</i> that is a subject or an object,
or stands in any other noun construction, can be a participle.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>While I was <i>travelling</i> in Mexico, I met with an accident. [Participle.]</li>

  <li><i>Travelling</i> broadens the mind. [Verbal noun, used as subject.]</li>

  <li>He enjoys <i>travelling</i>. [Verbal noun, used as object of a verb.]</li>

  <li>He spends his time in <i>travelling</i>. [Verbal noun, object of a preposition.]</li>

  <li>Tom’s favorite exercise is <i>swimming</i>. [Verbal noun, predicate nominative.]</li>

  <li>This sport, <i>fishing</i>, has been called the contemplative man’s recreation.
  [Verbal noun, in apposition with <i>sport</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p>That nouns in <i>-ing</i> are real nouns may be proved by putting
ordinary nouns in their place.</p>

<p id="s-348"><b>348.</b> <b>From nearly every English verb there may be formed a verbal
noun in <i>-ing</i>.</b></p>

<p><b>Verbal nouns in <i>-ing</i> have the form of present participles, but the
construction of nouns.</b></p>

<p>They are often called <b>participial nouns</b>.</p>

<p>Such nouns are freely used, either by themselves or in a
series along with ordinary nouns.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Mining</i> is a dangerous occupation.</li>

  <li><i>Painting</i> and <i>sculpture</i> are sister arts.</li>

  <li>The Indians of Massachusetts spent their time in <i>hunting</i>, <i>fishing</i>,
  <i>agriculture</i>, and <i>warfare</i>.</li>

  <li><i>Reading</i>, <i>writing</i>, and <i>arithmetic</i> are jocosely called “the three r’s.”</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-349"><a id="page-146" href="#page-146" class="pagenum" title="146"></a>
<b>349.</b> Verbal nouns in <i>-ing</i> have certain properties of the
<b>verb</b>.</p>

<p id="s-349-1">1. <b>Verbal nouns in <i>-ing</i> may take a direct or an indirect object if their
meaning allows.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Digging <i>gold</i> seems to the uninitiated like finding buried <i>treasure</i>.</li>

  <li>Lending <i>him money</i> is useless; it merely fosters his unthrifty habits.
  [Here the noun <i>lending</i>, which is the simple subject of the sentence,
  takes both a direct object (<i>money</i>) and an indirect object (<i>him</i>), precisely
  as the verb <i>lend</i> might do.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-349-2">2. <b>A verbal noun in <i>-ing</i> may take an adverbial modifier.</b></p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Speaking <i>extemporaneously</i> is good practice. [Here the verbal noun
<i>speaking</i> is the simple subject; but it is modified by the adverb <i>extemporaneously</i>,
precisely as if it were a verb.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But verbal nouns in <i>-ing</i>, like other nouns, may be modified
by <b>adjectives</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>Extemporaneous</i> speaking is good practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-349-3">3. <b>To the verbal nouns <i>being</i> and <i>having</i>, past participles may be
attached, so as to give the effect of voice and tense.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>After <i>being instructed</i> in my duties, I was ordered to wait on the king.</li>

  <li>There were grave doubts expressed as to his <i>having seen</i> the mastodon.</li>

  <li>After <i>having been treated</i> in so harsh a fashion, I had no wish to repeat
  the interview.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such expressions are <b>verbal noun-phrases</b>.</p>

<p id="s-350"><b>350.</b> Verbal nouns in <i>-ing</i> are similar in some of their constructions
to infinitives used as nouns (<a href="#page-135">p.&nbsp;135</a>).</p>

<p class="note">Nouns in <i>-ing</i> are sometimes called <b>infinitives</b> or <b>gerunds</b>.</p>

<p id="s-351"><b>351.</b> A noun in <i>-ing</i> may be used as an <b>adjective</b>, or as the
adjective element in a <b>compound noun</b> (<a href="#s-64">§&nbsp;64</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The <i>sleeping</i> car was completely wrecked.</li>

  <li>William has plenty of <i>spending</i> money.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><a id="page-147" href="#page-147" class="pagenum" title="147"></a>
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> Other examples are:—<i>a working day</i>, <i>an ironing board</i>, <i>drinking
water</i>, <i>smelling salts</i>, <i>marching orders</i>, <i>a walking tour</i>, <i>a swimming race</i>, <i>a
vaulting pole</i>. In such cases it makes little difference whether the two nouns
are taken together as a compound, or whether the first is regarded as an
adjective modifying the second. The difference between this use and that of
the participle is perfectly clear. A “<i>sleeping</i> dog” is a dog <i>that sleeps</i>; a
“<i>sleeping</i> car” is a car for <i>sleeping</i>. Sometimes, indeed, either explanation
is possible. Thus, a “<i>hoisting</i> engine” may be understood either as an “engine
<i>that hoists</i>,” or as an “engine <i>for hoisting</i>.” But it is better to class these
exceptions with the nouns in <i>-ing</i>.</p>

<p id="s-352"><b>352.</b> <b>When a verbal noun in <i>-ing</i> is preceded by an article or any
other adjective, it cannot take an object.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{Shooting song-birds | The shooting <i>of</i> song-birds} is forbidden.</li>
  <li>{Launching a ship | The launching <i>of</i> a ship} requires care and skill.</li>
  <li>{Drawing maps | The drawing <i>of</i> maps} is a useful exercise.</li>
  <li>{Eating confectionery constantly | Constant eating <i>of</i> confectionery} is bad for the teeth.</li>
  <li>My business is {driving wells. | the driving <i>of</i> wells.}</li>
</ul>

<p>Observe that, in each instance, the <b>object</b> (<i>song-birds</i>, <i>ship</i>,
<i>maps</i>, <i>confectionery</i>, <i>wells</i>) is replaced by a <b>prepositional phrase</b>
when an article or other adjective precedes the verbal noun.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In such expressions as “I went a-fishing,” <i>a</i> is a shortened form of
the preposition <i>on</i>, and <i>fishing</i> is a verbal noun used as its object. When <i>a</i> is
omitted we have “I went fishing,” “The house is building,” and the like,
in which the word in <i>-ing</i> seems to be a participle, but is really the object of
the omitted <i>a</i> (= <i>on</i>).</p>

<p id="s-353"><b>353.</b> The possessive case of a noun or pronoun may be used
to limit a verbal noun in <i>-ing</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I was sure of its <i>being</i> he. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: <i>it</i>.]</li>

  <li>I heard of Allen’s <i>being</i> elected. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: <i>Allen</i>.]</li>

<span class="subtitle">PREPOSITIONS</span></h3>

<p id="s-354"><b>354.</b> <b>A preposition is a word placed before a substantive to show its
relation to some other word in the sentence.</b></p>

<p><b>The substantive which follows a preposition is called its object and
is in the objective case.</b></p>

<p><b>A phrase consisting of a preposition and its object, with or without
other words, is called a prepositional phrase.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>On</i> the floor lay a heap <i>of</i> nuts.</li>
  <li>He stood <i>behind</i> the tree <i>for</i> some time.</li>
  <li><i>From</i> morning <i>till</i> night he remained <i>at</i> his post.</li>
  <li>The fire destroyed everything <i>except</i> a few articles <i>of</i> furniture.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>prepositional phrase</b> may be either adjective or adverbial.</p>

<p class="note">
Thus, in the first example, <i>of nuts</i> is an adjective phrase modifying the
noun <i>heap</i>, and <i>on the floor</i> is an adverbial phrase modifying the verb
<i>lay</i>. In the second sentence, the verb <i>stood</i> is modified by two adverbial
phrases, <i>behind the tree</i> and <i>for some time</i>.</p>

<p id="s-355"><b>355.</b> The following list includes most of the prepositions:</p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Such expressions as <i>by means of</i>, <i>in accordance with</i>, <i>in spite of</i>,
etc., are really phrases, but may be regarded as compound prepositions.</p>

<p>Several participles like <i>concerning</i>, <i>considering</i>, <i>pending</i>, are common in a
prepositional use and are therefore included in the list (<a href="#s-339">§&nbsp;339</a>).</p>

<p>For <i>a</i> (a form of <i>on</i>) in <i>abed</i>, <i>asleep</i>, <i>afire</i>, <i>a-fishing</i>, etc., see <a href="#s-352">§&nbsp;352</a>.</p>

</div>

<p id="s-356"><b>356.</b> A preposition may stand at the end of a sentence or
clause.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Whom</i> did you ask <i>for</i>? [Compare: <i>For whom</i> did you ask?]</li>

  <li>The box <i>which</i> it came <i>in</i> has been destroyed. [Compare: The box <i>in
  which</i> it came.]</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This order, though informal, is common in the best authors; but,
if carelessly used, it may result in awkwardness of style. Sometimes a relative
which is the object of the preposition is omitted (see <a href="#s-151">§&nbsp;151</a>). Thus, in the
second sentence, <i>which</i> might be dropped, and the object of <i>in</i> would then be
“<i>which</i>, understood.” For “He was laughed at,” and the like, see <a href="#s-251">§&nbsp;251</a>.</p>

<p>In poetry a preposition sometimes follows its object directly: as,—“Barefoot
plod I the cold ground <i>upon</i>” (<span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>).</p>
</div>

<p id="s-357"><b>357.</b> Certain adverbial expressions like “on Sunday,” “on

<ul class="example">
  <li>He came Sunday (<i>or</i>, on Sunday).</li>
  <li>We sail March first (<i>or</i>, on March first).</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The forms without <i>on</i> are good colloquial English, but are avoided

<i>but</i>) connects single words that are in the same construction
(subjects, objects, predicate adjectives, adverbs). In the fifth,
<i>but</i> connects an adverb with an adverbial phrase (both being
modifiers of the verb <i>embarked</i>). In the sixth, <i>and</i> joins the
two coördinate clauses of a compound sentence (<a href="#s-44">§&nbsp;44</a>). In the
seventh, <i>and</i> joins two coördinate clauses which, taken together,
make up the subordinate clause <i>until ... deserted</i>; this
clause may therefore be called a compound subordinate clause
(see <a href="#s-454">§&nbsp;454</a>).</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This omission is similar to that of the relative pronoun (<a href="#s-151">§&nbsp;151</a>). It
is extremely common, not only in colloquial language but also in literature,
whether prose or verse.</p>

<p id="s-368"><b>368.</b> <i>As</i> and <i>since</i> in the sense of “because,” and <i>while</i> in the
sense of “though,” are conjunctions.</p>

<p>When denoting <b>time</b>, <i>as</i> is an adverb, <i>while</i> is a noun or an

<p id="s-371"><b>371.</b> <b>Relative adverbs</b> are similar in their use to conjunctions,

a special class among the parts of speech. Thus the adverbs <i>since</i> and <i>while</i>

<span class="subtitle">INTERJECTIONS</span></h3>

<p id="s-372"><b>372.</b> <b>An interjection is a cry or other exclamatory sound expressing
surprise, anger, pleasure, or some other emotion or feeling.</b></p>

<div class="example inline">
  <span class="title smcap">Examples:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>O (<i>or</i> oh),</li>
    <li>ah,</li>
    <li>hullo (holloa, halloo),</li>
    <li>bah,</li>
    <li>pshaw,</li>

    <li>heigh-ho (heigh-o),</li>
    <li>alas,</li>
    <li>bravo,</li>
    <li>lo.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>When written, interjections are often followed by an exclamation
point (!).</p>

<p id="s-373"><b>373.</b> Among interjections are properly included calls to
animals (like “whoa!”) and imitations of sounds such as
“mew!” “cock-a-doodle-do!” “ding dong!” “swish!” “tu-whit-tu-who!”</p>

<p id="s-374"><b>374.</b> <b>Interjections usually have no grammatical connection with the
phrases or sentences in which they stand.</b></p>

<p>Hence they are counted among the “independent elements”
of a sentence (<a href="#s-501">§&nbsp;501</a>).</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, a substantive is connected with an
interjection by means of a preposition. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>O for</i> a camera!</li>
  <li><i>Alas for</i> my hopes!</li>
</ul>

<p>Adjectives and adverbs are also found in this use: as,—“Good
for you!” “Up with it!”</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> All such expressions are often regarded as elliptical sentences, as
if “O for a camera!” stood for “O, I wish for a camera!” and “Good for
you!” for “That is good for you!” But it is better to treat them as <b>exclamatory
phrases</b>.<a href="#footnote-42" id="marker-42" class="marker" title="Footnote 42"><sup>42</sup></a> Other exclamatory phrases are “Dear me!” “Goodness gracious!”
“O my!” and the like.</p>

<p id="s-375"><a id="page-156" href="#page-156" class="pagenum" title="156"></a>
<b>375.</b> Almost any part of speech may be used as an exclamation.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Nonsense!</i> I do not believe it.</li>
  <li>Fire!</li>
  <li>Halt!</li>
  <li><i>Good!</i> I like that!</li>
  <li>Forward!</li>
  <li>On!</li>
  <li>Away!</li>
  <li><i>Back</i>, villains!</li>
  <li><i>I!</i> not a bit of it!</li>
  <li>But——!</li>
</ul>

<p>Such words are often called interjections, but it is better to
describe them as nouns, adjectives, etc., used in exclamation,
and to confine the term <b>interjection</b> to words which belong to
no other part of speech.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Thus <i>nonsense!</i> and <i>fire!</i> are nouns in the exclamatory nominative;
<i>I!</i> is a pronoun in the same construction; <i>halt!</i> is a verb in the imperative
(compare <i>hark!</i> <i>hush!</i> <i>behold!</i> <i>look!</i>); <i>good!</i> is an adjective;
<i>forward!</i> <i>on!</i> <i>away!</i> and <i>back!</i> are adverbs; <i>but!</i> is a conjunction.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate various <b>exclamatory expressions</b>,—words,

<span class="subtitle">CLAUSES AS PARTS OF SPEECH</span></h3>

<p id="s-376"><b>376.</b> <b>A clause is a group of words that forms part of a sentence and
that contains a subject and a predicate.</b></p>

<p><b>A clause used as a part of speech is called a subordinate clause (<a href="#s-46">§&nbsp;46</a>).</b></p>

<p id="s-377"><b>377.</b> A subordinate clause may be introduced by (1) a
relative or an interrogative pronoun, (2) a relative or an
interrogative adverb, (3) a subordinate conjunction.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>The <b>relative pronouns</b> are: <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>that</i> (= <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>),
<i>as</i> (after <i>such</i> or <i>same</i>), and the compound relatives <i>whoever</i>, <i>whichever</i>,
<i>whatever</i>. Their uses have already been studied (<a href="#page-66">pp.&nbsp;66–73</a>).</p>

<p>The chief <b>relative adverbs</b> are: <i>where</i>, <i>whence</i>, <i>whither</i>, <i>wherever</i>, <i>when</i>,
<i>whenever</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>after</i>, <i>till</i>, <i>until</i>, <i>since</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i> (<a href="#page-86">p.&nbsp;86</a>).</p>

<p>The <b>interrogative pronouns</b> are: <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i> (<a href="#s-163">§§&nbsp;163–165</a>).</p>

<p>The <b>interrogative adverbs</b> are: <i>where</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>whence</i>, <i>whither</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i>.</p>

<p>The most important <b>subordinate conjunctions</b> are: <i>because</i>, <i>since</i> (= <i>because</i>),
<i>though</i>, <i>although</i>, <i>if</i>, <i>unless</i>, <i>that</i> (<i>in order that</i>, <i>so that</i>), <i>lest</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>as
if</i>, <i>as though</i>, <i>than</i>, <i>whether</i> (<i>whether ... or</i>).</p>
</div>

<p id="s-378"><b>378.</b> According to their use as parts of speech, subordinate
clauses are <b>adjective</b>, <b>adverbial</b>, or <b>noun clauses</b>.</p>

<h4>I. ADJECTIVE CLAUSES</h4>

<p id="s-379"><b>379.</b> <b>A subordinate clause that modifies a substantive is called an
adjective clause</b> (<a href="#s-47">§&nbsp;47</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{<i>Able</i> men | Men <i>of ability</i> | Men <i>who show ability</i>} can always find employment.</li>
  <li>{<i>Treeless</i> spots | Spots <i>without trees</i> | Spots <i>where no trees grew</i>} were plainly visible.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these groups, a noun (<i>men</i>, <i>spots</i>) is modified
(1) by an adjective, (2) by an adjective phrase, (3) by an
adjective clause. The sense remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="s-380"><a id="page-158" href="#page-158" class="pagenum" title="158"></a>
<b>380.</b> Adjective clauses may be introduced (1) by <b>relative
pronouns</b>, (2) by <b>relative adverbs</b> of place (<i>where</i>, <i>whence</i>, <i>whither</i>,
etc.) or time (<i>when</i>, <i>while</i>, etc.).</p>

<h4>II. ADVERBIAL CLAUSES</h4>

<p id="s-381"><b>381.</b> <b>A subordinate clause that serves as an adverbial modifier is
called an adverbial clause (<a href="#s-47">§&nbsp;47</a>).</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Jack spoke {<i>thoughtlessly</i>. | <i>without thinking</i>. | <i>before he thought</i>.}</li>
  <li>The schoolhouse stands {<i>there</i>. | <i>at the crossroads</i>. | <i>where the roads meet</i>.}</li>
  <li>We pay our rent {<i>monthly</i>. | <i>on the first of every month</i>. | <i>when the first of the month comes</i>.}</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these groups, the verb (<i>spoke</i>, <i>stands</i>, <i>pay</i>) is
modified (1) by an adverb, (2) by an adverbial phrase, (3) by
an adverbial clause.</p>

<p id="s-382"><b>382.</b> Adverbial clauses may be introduced (1) by relative
adverbs (<i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, <i>before</i>, etc.); (2) by subordinate conjunctions
(<i>if</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>because</i>, etc.); (3) by relative or interrogative
pronouns.</p>

<p id="s-383"><b>383.</b> Adverbial clauses oftenest modify verbs, but they are
also common as modifiers of adjectives and adverbs.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Angry <i>because he had failed</i>, he abandoned the undertaking. [The
  clause modifies <i>angry</i>.]</li>

  <li>I am uncertain <i>which road I should take</i>. [The clause modifies <i>uncertain</i>.]</li>

  <li>Farther <i>than eye could see</i> extended the waste of tossing waters. [The
  clause modifies <i>farther</i>.]</li>

  <li>Here, <i>where the cliff was steepest</i>, a low wall protected the path. [The
  clause modifies <i>here</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-384"><b>384.</b> An adverbial clause with <i>that</i> may be used to modify
verbs and adjectives.</p>
<a id="page-159" href="#page-159" class="pagenum" title="159"></a>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He rejoiced <i>that the victory was won</i>.</li>
  <li>I am glad <i>that you are coming</i>.</li>
  <li>He was positive <i>that no harm had been done</i>.</li>
  <li>They were unwilling <i>that the case should be brought to trial</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In this use <i>that</i> is equivalent either to “because” or to “as to the
fact that.” The clause may be explained as a noun clause in the adverbial
objective construction (<a href="#s-109">§&nbsp;109</a>).</p>

<p>For the classification of adverbial clauses according to their
meaning (place, time, cause, concession, etc.), see <a href="#page-163">pp.&nbsp;163–182</a>.</p>

<h4>III. NOUN (OR SUBSTANTIVE) CLAUSES</h4>

<p id="s-385"><b>385.</b> <b>A subordinate clause that is used as a noun is called a noun
(or substantive) clause (<a href="#s-47">§&nbsp;47</a>).</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{<i>Agreement</i> | <i>To agree</i> | <i>That we should agree</i>} seemed impossible.</li>
  <li>{<i>Victory</i> | <i>To win</i> | <i>That we should win</i>} was out of the question.</li>
  <li>The merchant feared {<i>loss</i>. | <i>to lose</i>. | <i>that he might lose money</i>.}</li>
  <li>I expect {<i>success</i>. | <i>to succeed</i>. | <i>that I shall succeed</i>.}</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these groups a noun (<i>agreement</i>, <i>victory</i>, etc.) is
replaced (1) by an infinitive, (2) by a noun clause. In the
first two examples, the noun clause is the subject; in the last
two, it is the object of a verb (<i>feared</i>, <i>expect</i>).</p>

<p id="s-386"><b>386.</b> Noun clauses may be used in any of the more important
constructions of nouns:—(1) as <b>subject</b>, (2) as <b>direct object</b>
of a transitive verb, (3) <b>in apposition</b> with a substantive, (4) as
a <b>predicate nominative</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>That Milton was spared</i> has often caused surprise. [Subject.]</li>
  <li>Brutus said <i>that Cæsar was a tyrant</i>. [Object of <i>said</i>.]</li>
  <li><a id="page-160" href="#page-160" class="pagenum" title="160"></a>Cæsar commanded <i>that the prisoners should be spared</i>. [Object.]</li>
  <li>I wish <i>that you would work harder</i>. [Object.]</li>
  <li>The traveller inquired <i>where he could find the inn</i>. [Object.]</li>
  <li>He asked me <i>what my name was</i>. [Second object of <i>asked</i>.]</li>
  <li>My fear <i>that the bridge might fall proved groundless</i>. [Apposition with
  <i>fear</i>.]</li>
  <li>One fact is undoubted,—<i>that the state of America has been kept in continual
  agitation</i>.<span class="attribution">—Burke.</span> [Apposition with <i>fact</i>.]</li>
  <li>The old saying is <i>that misery loves company</i>. [Predicate nominative.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-387"><b>387.</b> Noun clauses may be introduced (1) by the subordinate
conjunctions <i>that</i>, <i>whether</i> (<i>whether ... or</i>), and <i>if</i> (in the
sense of <i>whether</i>); (2) by the interrogative pronouns <i>who</i>,
<i>which</i>, <i>what</i>; (3) by the interrogative adverbs <i>where</i>, <i>whence</i>,
<i>whither</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i>, <i>when</i> (<a href="#s-196">§&nbsp;196</a>).</p>

<p id="s-388"><b>388.</b> Noun clauses are common as objects of verbs (1) of
<i>commanding</i>, <i>desiring</i>, etc.; (2) of <i>telling</i>, <i>thinking</i>, etc.; (3)

</ul>

<p class="note">
For a noun clause used as an adverbial objective, see <a href="#s-384">§&nbsp;384</a>.</p>

<p id="s-391"><b>391.</b> Noun clauses with <i>that</i> are common in the predicate
when the expletive <i>it</i> is the grammatical subject (<a href="#s-120-2">§&nbsp;120, 2</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>It was plain <i>that war was at hand</i>.</li>

  <li>It must be admitted <i>that there were many extenuating circumstances</i>.</li>

  <li>It was under the command of a foreign general <i>that the British had
  triumphed at Minden</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In such sentences the real subject of the thought is the
clause. This, however, may be regarded as grammatically in
apposition with <i>it</i>, as if one said “<i>It</i> (that war was at hand)
was plain.”</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This useful idiom enables us to adopt a kind of inverted order
(<a href="#s-5">§&nbsp;5</a>), and thus to shift the emphasis. Contrast “<i>That war was at hand</i> was
plain” with “<i>It was plain</i> that war was at hand.” In the former sentence,
the noun clause is made prominent; in the latter, the adjective <i>plain</i>.</p>

<span class="subtitle">THE MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES</span></h3>

<p id="s-393"><b>393.</b> Subordinate clauses may be classified not only according
to their use as parts of speech, but also, in quite a different
way, in accordance with their <b>various meanings</b>. These distinctions
in idea are of capital importance for the accurate and
forcible expression of thought.</p>

<p id="s-394"><b>394.</b> The variety of meanings which subordinate clauses
may express is great, but most of these meanings come under
the following heads:—(1) <b>place</b> or <b>time</b>, (2) <b>cause</b>, (3) <b>concession</b>,
(4) <b>purpose</b>, (5) <b>result</b>, (6) <b>condition</b>, (7) <b>comparison</b>,<a href="#footnote-43" id="marker-43" class="marker" title="Footnote 43"><sup>43</sup></a> (8) <b>indirect
discourse</b>, (9) <b>indirect question</b>.</p>

<p>The general meaning of the clause is usually indicated by
the word which introduces it.</p>

<h4>I. CLAUSES OF PLACE AND TIME</h4>

<p id="s-395"><b>395.</b> <b>An adjective or an adverbial clause may express place or time.</b></p>

<h5 class="smcap">I. Adjective Clauses</h5>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The house <i>where the robbery occurred</i> is No. 14.</li>
  <li>The bridge <i>over which we rode</i> is in ruins.</li>
  <li>There is a point <i>beyond which you cannot go</i>.</li>
  <li>The day <i>when</i> (or <i>on which</i>) <i>I was to sail</i> arrived at last.</li>
  <li>The day <i>before you came</i> was rainy.</li>
  <li>His terror <i>while it thundered</i> was pitiable.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="smcap">II. Adverbial Clauses</h5>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Remain <i>where I can see you</i>.</li>
  <li>That belongs <i>where you found it</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Whithersoever I go</i>, fear dogs my steps.</li>
  <li><i>Whenever the bell rings</i>, you must take down the receiver.</li>
  <li>Esmond heard the chimes <i>as he sat in his own chamber</i>.</li>
  <li>I have lived in Cairo <i>since my father died</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-396"><a id="page-164" href="#page-164" class="pagenum" title="164"></a>
<b>396.</b> Adjective clauses of place and time may be introduced
by relative pronouns (see examples above).</p>

<p>Adjective and adverbial clauses of place and time may be
introduced by relative adverbs. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Place</span>: where, whence, whither, wherever, whithersoever, wherefrom,
  whereto, etc.</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Time</span>: when, whenever, while, as, before, after, until, since.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
For <i>as</i> and <i>since</i> in causal clauses, see <a href="#s-398">§&nbsp;398</a>; for <i>while</i> in concessive
clauses, see <a href="#s-399">§&nbsp;399</a>.</p>

<p id="s-397"><b>397.</b> Clauses of time are sometimes shortened by the omission
of the copula and its subject.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>When [<i>he was</i>] rescued, he was almost dead.</li>
  <li>Tom was attacked by cramp <i>while swimming</i> across the river.</li>
</ul>

<h4>II. CAUSAL CLAUSES</h4>

<p id="s-398"><b>398.</b> <b>An adverbial clause may express cause.</b></p>

<p><b>Causal clauses</b> are introduced by the subordinate conjunctions
<i>because</i>, <i>since</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>inasmuch as</i>, and sometimes <i>that</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I came home <i>because I was tired</i>.</li>
  <li><i>As the day was clear</i>, we decided to climb the mountain.</li>
  <li><i>Since you will not relent</i>, you must take the consequences.</li>
  <li>We were glad <i>that the wreck was no worse</i>.</li>
  <li>Tom was delighted <i>that his friend was safe</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<i>Since</i> is a preposition or an adverb when it denotes <b>time</b>; <b>as</b> is an adverb
when it denotes <b>time</b>. Both <i>since</i> and <i>as</i> are conjunctions when they express
<b>cause</b>. For <i>as</i> used as a relative pronoun, see <a href="#s-147">§&nbsp;147</a>.</p>

<h4>III. CONCESSIVE CLAUSES</h4>

<p id="s-399"><b>399.</b> <b>An adverbial clause may express concession.</b></p>

<p>A <b>concessive clause</b> is usually introduced by a subordinate
conjunction, <i>though</i>, <i>although</i>, or <i>even if</i>. It <b>admits</b> (or concedes)
some fact or supposition <b>in spite of which</b> the assertion
in the main clause is made.</p>
<a id="page-165" href="#page-165" class="pagenum" title="165"></a>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Although I do not like his manners</i>, I respect his character.</li>

  <li>We won the game, <i>though we expected to lose</i>.</li>

  <li><i>Even if you fail</i>, you will have gained experience.</li>

  <li><i>Even if you were a king</i>, you would find somebody or something more
  powerful than yourself.</li>

  <li><i>Though he should read books forever</i>, he would not grow wise.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>While</i> is often used as a weaker or more courteous synonym for
<i>although</i>.</p>

<p>The main clause, when it follows the concessive clause, may
be emphasized by means of <i>yet</i>, <i>still</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Although the task was heavy, <i>yet</i> his courage never failed. [<i>Although</i>
  and <i>yet</i> are correlative conjunctions (<a href="#s-369">§&nbsp;369</a>).]</li>

  <li>Though his reputation was great at home, <i>yet</i> it was greater abroad.</li>
</ul>

<p>Concessive clauses sometimes omit the copula and its subject.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Though</i> [<i>he was</i>] <i>tired</i>, he was not disheartened.</li>

  <li>This punishment, <i>though perhaps necessary</i>, seems rather severe.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-400"><b>400.</b> For the distinction between the indicative and the
subjunctive in concessive clauses, see <a href="#s-279">§&nbsp;279</a>; for that between
<i>should</i> and <i>would</i>, see <a href="#s-305">§&nbsp;305</a>.</p>

<p id="s-401"><b>401.</b> A concessive clause may be introduced by the conjunction
<i>as</i>, or by a relative pronoun or a relative adverb.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{<i>Whatever</i> you say, | <i>Whichever</i> argument you present, | <i>However</i> much you object,} he will carry his point.</li>
  <li><i>Weak as I am</i>, I will make the effort.</li>
  <li><i>Gay as the scene was</i>, ’twas but a dreary place for Mr. Esmond.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The adverbial use of <i>however</i> is quite distinct from its use as a
coördinate conjunction (<a href="#s-362">§&nbsp;362</a>).</p>

<p id="s-402"><b>402.</b> Concession is sometimes expressed by a subjunctive
clause without a conjunction to introduce it (<a href="#s-281">§&nbsp;281</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Be it ever so humble</i>, there’s no place like home.</li>

  <li>I will help you, <i>cost what it may</i>!</li>
</ul>
<a id="page-166" href="#page-166" class="pagenum" title="166"></a>

<h4>IV–V. CLAUSES OF PURPOSE AND OF RESULT</h4>

<p id="s-403"><b>403.</b> <b>A subordinate clause may express purpose or result.</b></p>

<h5 class="smcap">I. Clauses of Purpose</h5>

<ul class="example">
  <li>These men died <i>that we might live</i>.</li>

  <li>I will take care <i>that you are not harmed</i>.</li>

  <li>John worked day and night <i>that the plans might be ready in time</i>.</li>

  <li>We threw our ballast overboard, <i>so that the airship might clear the
  treetops</i>.</li>

  <li>All our arrangements have been made with the utmost precision, <i>in
  order that the ship may be launched promptly and without accident</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="smcap">II. Clauses of Result</h5>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He has recovered his strength, <i>so that he can now work</i>.</li>

  <li>The town stood at the foot of the volcano, <i>so that every building was
  destroyed</i>.</li>

  <li>Quentin started <i>so</i> suddenly <i>that he almost dropped his weapon</i>.</li>

  <li>His rancor against the duke was <i>so</i> apparent <i>that one saw it in the first
  half-hour’s conversation</i>.</li>

  <li>Their minds were <i>so</i> much embittered <i>that they imputed to each other
  nothing less than deliberate villany</i>.</li>

  <li>You make <i>such</i> a noise <i>that I cannot hear the music</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-404"><b>404.</b> <b>Clauses of purpose</b> may be introduced by the subordinate
conjunction <i>that</i> or by a phrase containing it (<i>so that</i>, <i>in order
that</i>, <i>to the end that</i>, etc.).</p>

<p>Negative clauses of purpose may be introduced by <i>that ... not</i>
or by <i>lest</i>. For <i>lest</i> with the subjunctive, see <a href="#s-284">§&nbsp;284</a>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Take heed <i>lest thou fall</i>.</li>

  <li>I feared <i>lest I might anger thee</i>.<span class="attribution">—Shakspere.</span></li>
</ul>

<p id="s-405"><b>405.</b> <b>Clauses of result</b> may be introduced by the phrase <i>so
that</i>, consisting of the adverb <i>so</i> and the subordinate conjunction
<i>that</i>; or by <i>that</i> alone, especially when <i>so</i>, <i>such</i>, or some
similar word stands in the main clause.</p>

<p id="s-406"><b>406.</b> A clause of <b>purpose</b> or of <b>result</b> may be either an
<b>adverbial clause</b> (as in <a href="#s-403">§&nbsp;403</a>) or a <b>substantive clause</b>.</p>
<a id="page-167" href="#page-167" class="pagenum" title="167"></a>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I intend <i>that you shall be elected</i>. [Object.]</li>

  <li>My intention is <i>that you shall be appointed</i>. [Predicate nominative.]</li>

  <li>The result is <i>that he is bankrupt</i>. [Predicate nominative.]</li>

  <li>His exertions had this effect, <i>that the vote was unanimous</i>. [Appositive.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-407"><b>407.</b> A substantive clause of purpose is often used as the
<b>object</b> of a verb of <i>commanding</i>, <i>desiring</i>, or the like.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The general ordered <i>that the fort should be blown up</i>.</li>

  <li>The prisoner begged <i>that his fetters might be struck off</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-408"><b>408.</b> For subordinate clauses with <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i>, implying
purpose or expectation, see <a href="#s-304">§&nbsp;304</a>.</p>

<p id="s-409"><b>409.</b> Purpose may be expressed by the infinitive with <i>to</i> or
<i>in order to</i>, and result by the infinitive with <i>to</i> or <i>as to</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He abandoned his profession <i>to</i> [or <i>in order to</i>] <i>become a missionary</i>.
  [Purpose.]</li>

  <li>He was kind enough <i>to help me</i>. [Result. Compare: He was so kind
  <i>that he helped me</i>.]</li>

  <li>He was so kind <i>as to help me</i>. [Result.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Negative result</b> is often expressed by the adverb <i>too</i> and the
infinitive.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Iron is <i>too</i> heavy <i>to float</i>. [Compare: Iron is so heavy <i>that it does not
float</i>.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-410"><b>410.</b> Purpose may be expressed by an <b>infinitive clause</b> (<a href="#s-325">§&nbsp;325</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The teacher intended <i>us to finish the book</i>. [Compare: The teacher
  intended <i>that we should finish the book</i>.]</li>

  <li>The foreman ordered <i>the engine to be stopped</i>. [Compare: The foreman
  ordered <i>that the engine should be stopped</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<h4>VI. CONDITIONAL SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-411"><b>411.</b> <b>A clause that expresses a condition introduced by <i>if</i>, or by some
equivalent word or phrase, is called a conditional clause.</b></p>

<p><b>A sentence that contains a conditional clause is called a conditional
sentence.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>If it rains</i>, we shall remain at home.</li>

  <li>I shall attend the convention <i>if I am in town</i>.</li>

  <li>I will take this book, <i>if you please</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-412"><a id="page-168" href="#page-168" class="pagenum" title="168"></a>
<b>412.</b> A <i>conditional sentence</i> in its simplest form consists of
two parts:—</p>

<p>(1) A subordinate (adverbial) clause, commonly introduced
by <i>if</i>, and expressing the <b>condition</b>.</p>

<p>(2) A main clause expressing the <b>conclusion</b>, that is, the
statement which is true in case the condition expressed in the
<i>if</i>-clause is true.</p>

<p class="note">
Thus in the first example in <a href="#s-411">§&nbsp;411</a>, the <b>condition</b> is <i>if it rains</i>; the <b>conclusion</b>
is <i>we shall remain at home</i>.</p>

<p>Either the condition or the conclusion may come first.</p>

<p class="note">
The conditional clause is often called the <b>protasis</b>, and the conclusion is
often called the <b>apodosis</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>conclusion</b> of a conditional sentence may be declarative,
interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>If you go to Philadelphia, <i>where shall you stay</i>? [Interrogative.]</li>

  <li><i>Sit here</i>, if you wish. [Imperative.]</li>

  <li>If you win the prize, <i>how glad I shall be</i>! [Exclamatory.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-413"><b>413.</b> A conditional clause may be introduced by <i>provided</i>
(or <i>provided that</i>), <i>granted that</i>, <i>supposing</i> (or <i>suppose</i>), <i>on
condition that</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I will permit you to go, <i>on condition that</i> you come home early.</li>

  <li>You may have the money, <i>provided</i> you will put it in the bank.</li>

  <li><i>Supposing</i> (or <i>suppose</i>) it rains, what shall we do?</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<i>Suppose</i> is really an imperative and <i>supposing</i> a participle, the clause being
the object.</p>

<p id="s-414"><b>414.</b> A <b>negative condition</b> is commonly introduced by <i>if ... not</i>
or <i>unless</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I will wait for him, <i>if</i> you do <i>not</i> object.</li>

  <li><i>Unless</i> you overcome that habit, you will be ruined.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-415"><b>415.</b> <b>Double</b> (or <b>alternative</b>) <b>conditions</b> may be introduced by
<i>whether ... or</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Whether</i> he goes or stays, he must pay a week’s board. [Compare: <i>If</i>
  he goes <i>or if</i> he stays, etc.]</li>

  <li>He is determined to buy that car, <i>whether</i> you approve <i>or</i> not. [That
  is: <i>if</i> you approve <i>or if</i> you do not approve.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-416"><a id="page-169" href="#page-169" class="pagenum" title="169"></a>
<b>416.</b> A conditional clause may be introduced by <i>whoever</i>,
<i>whenever</i>, or some similar compound (<a href="#s-159">§§&nbsp;159</a>, <a href="#s-195">195</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Whoever</i> offends, is punished. [Compare: <i>If anybody</i> offends, he is
  punished.]</li>

  <li><i>Whoever</i> shall offend, shall be punished.</li>

  <li><i>Whomever</i> you ask, you will be disappointed. [Compare: If you shall
  ask anybody.]</li>

  <li>He will come <i>whenever</i> [= <i>if ever</i>] he is called.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English and in poetry, <i>who</i> is common in this construction:
as,—“<i>Who</i> [= <i>whoever</i>] steals my purse, steals trash” (<span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>).</p>

<p id="s-417"><b>417.</b> A conditional clause sometimes omits the copula and
its subject.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I will go if [<i>it is</i>] necessary.</li>

  <li>If [<i>it is</i>] possible, come to-morrow.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>if</i>-clause is sometimes used as an exclamation, with the
conclusion omitted.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>If I only had a rifle!</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-418"><b>418.</b> A condition may be expressed by means of an assertion,
a question, an imperative, or the absolute construction (<a href="#s-345">§&nbsp;345</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>We take the receiver from the hook, and the operator answers. We
  replace it, and the connection is broken. [Compare: If we take the

  <li>Press that button, and the bell will ring.</li>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In such cases, there is no subordinate conditional clause. Thus, in

<h5>FORMS OF CONDITIONS</h5>

<p id="s-419"><b>419.</b> Conditional sentences show great variety of form, but
it is easy to classify them according to the <b>time</b> of the supposed
case and the <b>degree of doubt</b> that the speaker expresses.</p>

<p id="s-420"><b>420.</b> Conditions may be <b>present</b>, <b>past</b>, or <b>future</b>.</p>
<a id="page-170" href="#page-170" class="pagenum" title="170"></a>

<h6>Present and Past Conditions</h6>

<p id="s-421"><b>421.</b> Present and past conditions may be either (1) <b>non-committal</b>
or (2) <b>contrary to fact</b>.</p>

<p>1. A condition is <b>non-committal</b> when it implies nothing as
to the truth or falsity of the case supposed.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>If James is angry</i>, I am sorry. [Perhaps James is angry, perhaps not.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. A condition is <b>contrary to fact</b> when it implies that the
supposed case is not or was not true.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>If James were angry</i>, I should be sorry. [James is <i>not</i> angry.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-422"><b>422.</b> In a <b>non-committal present condition</b>, the <i>if</i>-clause<a href="#footnote-44" id="marker-44" class="marker" title="Footnote 44"><sup>44</sup></a> takes
the present indicative; in a <b>non-committal past condition</b>, the
past, the perfect, or the pluperfect.</p>

<p>The conclusion may be in any form that the sense allows.</p>

<h6>I. Present Condition, Non-committal</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>If this pebble is a diamond</i>,
  {it is valuable. | guard it carefully. | you have made a great discovery.
  | you will get a large sum for it. | why are you so careless of it? | what a prize it is!}</li>
  <li><i>If it is raining</i>, shut the window.</li>
  <li><i>If Jack lives in this house</i>, {he is a lucky boy. | ring the bell. | he has moved since last May.}</li>
</ul>

<h6>II. Past Condition, Non-committal</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>If that pebble was a diamond</i>, {it was valuable. | why did you throw it away? | go back and look for it.}</li>
  <li><i>If Tom has apologized</i>, {he has done his duty. | you ought to excuse him. | forgive him.}</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><i>If John had reached home before we started</i>, he must have made a
quick journey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="page-171" href="#page-171" class="pagenum" title="171"></a>
In each of these examples, the speaker declines to commit
himself as to the truth of the supposed case. Perhaps the
pebble was a diamond, perhaps not; Tom may or may not
have apologized; whether or not John had reached home, we
cannot tell.</p>

<p id="s-423"><b>423.</b> In a <b>condition contrary to fact</b>, the <i>if</i>-clause takes the
past subjunctive when the condition refers to present time,
the pluperfect subjunctive when it refers to past time.</p>

<p>The conclusion regularly takes <i>should</i> or <i>would</i> (<a href="#s-286-3">§&nbsp;286, 3</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>If John <i>were</i> here, I <i>should recognize</i> him. [Present condition, present
  conclusion.]</li>

  <li>If John <i>were</i> here, I <i>should have recognized</i> him before this. [Present
  condition, past conclusion.]</li>

  <li>If I <i>had offended</i> him, I <i>should have regretted</i> it. [Past condition, past
  conclusion.]</li>

  <li>If I <i>had</i> then <i>offended</i> him, I <i>should regret</i> it now. [Past condition,
  present conclusion.]</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these sentences, the speaker distinctly implies
that the supposed case (or <b>condition</b>) <i>is</i> (or <i>was</i>) <i>not a fact</i>.
It follows, of course, that the <b>conclusion</b> is not a fact:—John
is <i>not</i> here; therefore I <i>do not</i> recognize him.</p>

<p id="s-424"><b>424.</b> In conditions contrary to fact, the subjunctive without
<i>if</i> is common. In this use, the subject follows the verb (<a href="#s-281">§&nbsp;281</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Were</i> he my friend, I should expect his help. [= If he <i>were</i> my friend.
  Present condition, contrary to fact.]</li>

  <li><i>Had</i> he <i>been</i> my friend, I should have expected his help. [= If he
  <i>had been</i> my friend. Past condition, contrary to fact.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English, the subjunctive may be used in both clauses: as,—“He
<i>were</i> no lion, <i>were</i> not Romans hinds” (<span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>).</p>

<h6>Future Conditions</h6>

<p id="s-425"><b>425.</b> <b>Future conditions</b> always imply <b>doubt</b>, for no one can tell
what may or may not happen to-morrow.</p>

<p id="s-426"><b>426.</b> In all future conditions, some verb-form denoting
future time is used in both clauses.</p>

<p><a id="page-172" href="#page-172" class="pagenum" title="172"></a>
1. In a future condition which suggests nothing as to the
probability or improbability of the case supposed, the present
indicative is regularly used in the <i>if</i>-clause, and the future
indicative in the conclusion.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>If it <i>rains</i> to-morrow, I <i>shall</i> not <i>go</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
In very formal or exact language a verb-phrase with <i>shall</i> may be used in
the <i>if</i>-clause: as,—“If it <i>shall rain</i> to-morrow, I shall not go.”</p>

<p>2. The present subjunctive is sometimes used in the <i>if</i>-clause.
This form commonly suggests more doubt than the
present indicative.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>If it <i>rain</i> to-morrow, I shall not go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3. In a future condition which puts the supposed case rather
vaguely, often with a considerable suggestion of doubt, a verb-phrase
with <i>should</i> or <i>would</i> is used in both clauses.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>If it <i>should rain</i> to-morrow, I <i>should</i> not <i>go</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the use of <i>should</i> or <i>would</i> in such clauses, see <a href="#s-305">§&nbsp;305</a>.</p>

<p>A phrase with <i>were to</i> may replace the <i>should</i>-phrase in the
<i>if</i>-clause. This form often emphasizes the suggestion of doubt.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>If it <i>were to rain</i> to-morrow, I should not go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The past subjunctive may stand in the <i>if</i>-clause instead of
the <i>should</i>-phrase.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>If it <i>rained</i> to-morrow, I should not go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The comparative amount of doubt implied in the different kinds of
future conditions cannot be defined with precision; for it varies with the circumstances
or the context, and often depends on emphasis or the tone of the
voice. Thus, in “if it should rain to-morrow,” <i>should</i> may be so emphasized
as to make the supposed case seem highly improbable, whereas an emphasis
on <i>to-morrow</i> would have a very different effect. As to the subjunctive, its
use is often due rather to the writer’s liking for that mood than to any special
doubt in his mind.</p>

<h4>VII. CLAUSES OF COMPARISON</h4>

<p id="s-428"><b>428.</b> <b>An adverbial clause introduced by <i>as if</i> may express comparison.</b><a href="#footnote-45" id="marker-45" class="marker" title="Footnote 45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You speak <i>as if you were angry</i>.<a href="#footnote-46" id="marker-46" class="marker" title="Footnote 46"><sup>46</sup></a></li>

  <li>He breathes <i>as if he were exhausted</i>.</li>

  <li>She cared for me <i>as if I had been her son</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<i>As though</i> is also used, but <i>as if</i> is now preferred by most writers.</p>

<p>The subjunctive <i>were</i>, not the indicative <i>was</i>, is used after
<i>as if</i> (<a href="#s-282">§&nbsp;282</a>).</p>

<p id="s-429"><b>429.</b> <i>As</i> and <i>than</i>, as subordinate conjunctions, introduce
<b>clauses of comparison</b> or <b>degree</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You are as old <i>as he</i> [<i>is</i>].</li>

  <li>I am younger <i>than you</i> [<i>are</i>].</li>

  <li>He weighs as much <i>as I</i> [<i>weigh</i>].</li>

  <li>I pity you more <i>than</i> [<i>I pity</i>] <i>her</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the verb is omitted, the substantive that follows <i>as</i>
or <i>than</i> is in the same case in which it would stand if the
verb were expressed. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You are stronger than <i>he</i>. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: than <i>him</i>.]</li>

  <li>I see you oftener than <i>him</i>. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: than <i>he</i>.]</li>

  <li>He plays a better game than <i>I</i>. [<span class="smcap">Not</span>: than <i>me</i>.]</li>

  <li>They will miss John more than <i>me</i>. [That is: more than they miss <i>me</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<h4>VIII. INDIRECT DISCOURSE</h4>

<p id="s-430"><b>430.</b> A quotation may be <b>direct</b> or <b>indirect</b>.</p>

<p>A <b>direct quotation</b> repeats a speech or thought in its original
form.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I replied: “I am sorry to hear it.”</li>
  <li>“Henceforth,” he explained, “I shall call on Tuesdays.”</li>
  <li>“You must see California,” she insisted.</li>
  <li><a id="page-174" href="#page-174" class="pagenum" title="174"></a>“Elizabeth no longer lives here,” he said.</li>
  <li>“I know nothing about it,” was the witness’s reply.</li>
  <li>“Where,” thought I, “are the crew?”<a href="#footnote-47" id="marker-47" class="marker" title="Footnote 47"><sup>47</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>An <b>indirect quotation</b> repeats a speech or thought in substance,
but usually with some change in its form.</p>

<p>An indirect quotation, when a statement, is a subordinate
clause dependent on some word of <i>saying</i> or <i>thinking</i>, and
introduced by the conjunction <i>that</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I replied <i>that I was sorry to hear it</i>. [Direct: I am sorry.]</li>
  <li>He explained <i>that henceforth he should call on Tuesdays</i>.</li>
  <li>She insisted <i>that I must see California</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>A direct quotation</b> begins with a <b>capital letter</b>, unless it is a fragment
of a sentence. It is enclosed in <b>quotation marks</b>.</p>

<p><b>An indirect quotation</b> begins with a <b>small letter</b>. It usually has
no quotation marks.</p>

<p id="s-431"><b>431.</b> <b>A substantive clause introduced by <i>that</i> may be used with verbs
and other expressions of <i>telling</i>, <i>thinking</i>, <i>knowing</i>, and <i>perceiving</i>, to report
the words or thought of a person in substance, but usually with some
change of form.</b></p>

<p><b>Such clauses are said to be in the indirect discourse.</b></p>

<p class="note">
For distinction, a remark or a thought in its original form (as in a direct
quotation) is said to be in the <b>direct discourse</b>.</p>

<p id="s-432"><b>432.</b> Statements in <i>indirect discourse</i>, being substantive
clauses, may be used in various noun constructions: (1) as
<b>object</b> of some verb of <i>telling</i>, <i>thinking</i>, or the like, (2) as <b>subject</b>,
(3) as <b>predicate nominative</b>, (4) as <b>appositive</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He said <i>that the box was empty</i>. [Object.]</li>
  <li><i>That the box was empty</i> was all he could say. [Subject.]</li>
  <li>My remark was <i>that the bill is a menace</i>. [Predicate nominative.]</li>
  <li>Your remark, <i>that the bill is a menace</i>, has aroused vigorous protest.
  [Apposition.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-433"><a id="page-175" href="#page-175" class="pagenum" title="175"></a>
<b>433.</b> The conjunction <i>that</i> is often omitted.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Jack said [<i>that</i>] he was sorry.</li>

  <li>I hope [<i>that</i>] you can come.</li>

  <li>I know he is too busy a man to have leisure for me.<span class="attribution">—Cowper.</span></li>
</ul>

<p id="s-434"><b>434.</b> In indirect discourse, after the past or the pluperfect
tense, the present tense of the direct discourse becomes past,
and the perfect becomes pluperfect.</p>

<ul class="example numbered">
  <li><span class="float-l">1.</span> <span class="smcap">Direct:</span> I <i>am</i> tired.</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Indirect:</span> John {said | had said} that he <i>was</i> tired.</li>
  <li><span class="float-l">2.</span> <span class="smcap">Direct:</span> I <i>have won</i>.</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Indirect:</span> John {said | had said} that he <i>had won</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But a general or universal truth always remains in the
present tense.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Direct:</span> Air <i>is</i> a gas.</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Indirect:</span> I told him that air <i>is</i> a gas.</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Indirect:</span> I had told him a hundred times that air <i>is</i> a gas.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-435"><b>435.</b> The clause with <i>that</i> in indirect discourse is sometimes
replaced by an infinitive clause (<a href="#s-325">§&nbsp;325</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The jury declared <i>him to be innocent</i>. [Compare: The jury declared
  <i>that he was innocent</i>.]</li>

  <li>Morton admitted <i>them to be counterfeit</i>. [Compare: Morton admitted
  <i>that they were counterfeit</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
In these sentences, <i>him</i> and <i>them</i> are, of course, the subjects of the infinitives,
not the objects of <i>declared</i> and <i>admitted</i>.</p>

<p id="s-436"><b>436.</b> When the verb of <i>telling</i> or <i>thinking</i> is in the <b>passive
voice</b>, three constructions occur:—</p>

<p id="s-436-1">1. A clause with <i>that</i> is used as the subject of the passive
verb.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>That Rogers desires the office is commonly reported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-436-2">2. The expletive <i>it</i> is used as the grammatical subject, and
a <i>that</i>-clause follows the passive verb.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>It is commonly reported that Rogers desires the office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="s-436-3"><a id="page-176" href="#page-176" class="pagenum" title="176"></a>
3. The subject of the <i>that</i>-clause becomes the subject of the
passive verb, and the verb of the clause is replaced by an
infinitive.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Rogers is commonly reported to desire the office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The choice among these three idioms is largely a matter of
emphasis or euphony. The first may easily become heavy or
awkward, and it is therefore less common than either of the
others.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The third of these idioms is often called the <b>personal construction</b>,
to distinguish it from the second, in which the grammatical subject is the impersonal
<i>it</i> (<a href="#s-120-1">§&nbsp;120, 1</a>). The infinitive in this third idiom may be regarded as a
peculiar adverbial modifier of the passive verb.</p>

<p>Further examples of the three constructions with passive
verbs of <i>telling</i>, <i>thinking</i>, etc., are the following:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>That in vivacity, humor, and eloquence, the Irish stand high among
  the nations of the world is now universally acknowledged.<span class="attribution">—Macaulay.</span></li>

  <li>This is said to be the only château in France in which the ancient
  furniture of its original age is preserved.<span class="attribution">—Longfellow.</span></li>
</ul>

<p id="s-437"><b>437.</b> A substantive clause with <i>that</i> is common after <i>it seems</i>,
<i>it is true</i>, <i>it is evident</i>, and similar expressions.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>It seems <i>that Robert has lost all his money</i>.</li>
  <li>It is true <i>that genius does not always bring happiness with it</i>.</li>
  <li>It is evident <i>that Andrews tells the truth</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
This construction is really the same as that in <a href="#s-436-2">§&nbsp;436, 2</a>.</p>

<p id="s-438"><a id="page-177" href="#page-177" class="pagenum" title="177"></a>
<b>438.</b> The uses of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>, <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>, in <b>indirect
discourse</b> are the same as in the <b>direct</b>,<a href="#footnote-48" id="marker-48" class="marker" title="Footnote 48"><sup>48</sup></a> with the following
exception:—</p>

<p><b>When the first person with <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i> in direct discourse becomes
the second or third person in the indirect, <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i> is retained.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Direct:</span>    You say, “<i>I shall</i> die.”</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Indirect:</span>  You say that <i>you shall</i> die.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Direct:</span>    You said, “<i>I shall</i> die.”</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Indirect:</span>  You said that <i>you should</i> die.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Direct:</span>    He says, “<i>I shall</i> die.”</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Indirect:</span>  He says that <i>he shall</i> die.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="smcap">Direct:</span>    He said, “<i>I shall</i> die.”</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Indirect:</span>  He said that <i>he should</i> die.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for the retention of <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i> is that, in
such cases, the second or third person of the indirect discourse
represents the first person of the direct.</p>

<p>The change from <i>shall</i> (after <i>says</i>) to <i>should</i> (after <i>said</i>) is
a mere change of tense, according to the rule in <a href="#s-434">§&nbsp;434</a>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The general principle is, to retain in the indirect discourse the auxiliary
of the direct, simply changing the tense if necessary (<a href="#s-434">§&nbsp;434</a>). This principle
of course covers the use of <i>you</i> or <i>he shall</i> or <i>should</i> to represent <i>I
shall</i> or <i>should</i>. There is, however, one important exception to the general
principle: when its application would result in the use of <i>I will</i> or <i>I would</i> to
express mere futurity, <i>I shall</i> or <i>I should</i> is employed. Thus, John says to
Charles, “If you fall overboard, <i>you will</i> drown”<!--TN: added closing quote-->; but Charles, reporting this,
must say, “John tells me that, if I fall overboard, <i>I shall</i> [<span class="smaller">NOT</span> <i>will</i>] drown.”
The general rule, then, may be stated as follows: The indirect discourse retains
the auxiliary of the direct (with a change in tense, if necessary), unless
such retention makes <i>will</i> or <i>would</i> express simple futurity in the first person,—in
that case, <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i> is used.</p>

<p id="s-439"><b>439.</b> The following sentences illustrate the correct use of
<i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>, <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>, in the indirect discourse:—</p>

<h4>IX. INDIRECT QUESTIONS</h4>

<p id="s-440"><b>440.</b> <b>A question expressed in the form actually used in asking it is
called a direct question.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>What is your name?</li>
  <li>“What is your name?” he asked.</li>
</ul>

<p>The direct form may be retained when the question is quoted
or reported, as in the second example above. Often, however,
a question is quoted or reported, not in the direct form, but in
the form of a <b>subordinate clause</b>: as,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>He asked <i>what my name was</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a clause is called an <b>indirect question</b>.</p>

<p id="s-441"><b>441.</b> <b>An indirect question expresses the substance of a direct question
in the form of a subordinate clause.</b></p>

<p><b>Indirect questions depend on verbs or other expressions of <i>asking</i>,
<i>doubting</i>, <i>thinking</i>, <i>perceiving</i>, and the like.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Franklin asked <i>where the difficulty lay</i>. [Direct question: “Where
  does the difficulty lie?”]</li>

  <li>The sergeant wondered <i>how he should escape</i>. [Direct question: “How
  shall I escape?”]</li>

  <li>I have not decided <i>which train I shall take</i>. [Direct question: “Which
  train shall I take?”]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-442"><b>442.</b> Both <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect questions</b> may be introduced (1)
by the interrogative pronouns <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>; (2) by the
interrogative adverbs <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, <i>whence</i>, <i>whither</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i>.</p>

<p><b>Indirect questions</b> may be introduced by the subordinate conjunctions
<i>whether</i> (<i>whether ... or</i>) and <i>if</i>.</p>

<p>The use of <b>tenses</b> in indirect questions is the same as in the
indirect discourse (<a href="#s-434">§&nbsp;434</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The constable inquired <i>whether</i> (or <i>if</i>) <i>I lived in Casterbridge</i>. [His
  question was: Do you live in Casterbridge?]</li>

  <li>Your father wishes to know <i>if you have been playing truant</i>. [Direct
  question: Have you been playing truant?]</li>

  <li>I considered <i>whether I should apply to Kent or to Arnold</i>. [Direct
  question: Shall I apply to Kent or to Arnold?]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-443"><a id="page-180" href="#page-180" class="pagenum" title="180"></a>
<b>443.</b> Indirect questions are usually noun clauses. They may
be used in various noun constructions: (1) as <b>object</b> of some verb
of <b>asking</b> or the like, (2) as <b>subject</b>, (3) as <b>predicate nominative</b>,
(4) as <b>appositive</b>, (5) as <b>object</b> of a preposition.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The skipper asked <i>what had become of the cook</i>. [Object.]</li>

  <li>He was asked <i>what his profession was</i>. [Retained object after the
  passive (<a href="#s-253">§§&nbsp;253</a>, <a href="#s-389">389</a>).]</li>

  <li><i>How we could escape</i> was a difficult question. [Subject.]</li>

  <li>The problem was <i>how they should find food</i>. [Predicate nominative.]</li>

  <li>The question <i>who was to blame</i> has never been settled. [Apposition
  with <i>question</i>.]</li>

  <li>They all felt great perplexity as to <i>what they should do</i>. [Object of a
  preposition.]</li>
</ul>

<p>An indirect question may be an adverbial clause.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>They were uncertain <i>what course they should take</i>. [The clause modifies
  <i>uncertain</i>.]</li>

  <li>Edmund was in doubt <i>where he should spend the night</i>. [The clause
  modifies the adjective phrase <i>in doubt</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-444"><b>444.</b> Since the pronouns <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>what</i> may be either
interrogative or relative, an indirect question may closely resemble
a relative clause. These two constructions, however,
are sharply distinguished. A relative clause always <b>asserts</b> something.
An indirect question, on the contrary, has an <b>interrogative</b>
sense which may be seen by turning the question into the direct
form.</p>

<p class="example">
The sailor <i>who saved the child</i> is a Portuguese. [The clause <i>who saved
the child</i> is a relative clause, for it makes a distinct assertion about the
sailor,—namely, that he saved the child. <i>Who</i> is a relative pronoun
and <i>sailor</i> is its antecedent.]</p>

<p class="example">{I asked | I do not know | It is still a question | It is doubtful} <i>who saved the child</i>.
<!--TN: not a new paragraph-->
[Here the clause <i>who saved the child</i> makes no assertion. On the contrary,
it expresses a question which may easily be put in a direct form
with an interrogation point: “Who saved the child?” <i>Who</i> is an interrogative
pronoun. It has no antecedent.]</p>

<p><a id="page-181" href="#page-181" class="pagenum" title="181"></a>
The following examples further illustrate the difference between
these two constructions:—</p>

<ul class="example numbered">
  <li><span class="float-l">1.</span> I foresee the course <i>which he will take</i>. [Relative clause.]</li>

  <li>I foresee <i>which course he will take</i>. [Indirect question.]</li>

  <li><span class="float-l">2.</span> I heard <i>what he said</i>. [Relative clause. <i>What</i> = “that which.”]</li>

  <li>I wondered <i>what he said</i>. [Indirect question. <i>What</i> is an interrogative
  pronoun.]</li>

  <li><span class="float-l">3.</span> This is the man <i>who brought the news</i>. [Relative clause.]</li>

  <li>The king asked <i>who brought the news</i>. [Indirect question.]</li>

  <li><span class="float-l">4.</span> Here is a paper <i>which you must sign</i>. [Relative clause.]</li>

  <li>The clerk will tell you <i>which paper you must sign</i>. [Indirect question.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note</span>. In such a sentence as “Tom knows <i>who saved the child</i>,” the indirect
question may at first appear to be a relative clause with an omitted
antecedent (<i>the man</i>, or <i>the person</i>). If, however, we insert such an antecedent
(“Tom knows <i>the man</i> who saved the child”), the meaning is completely
changed. In the original sentence, it is stated that Tom knows the
answer to the question, “Who saved the child?” In the new form of the sentence,
it is stated that Tom is acquainted with a certain person, and to this is
added an assertion about this person in the form of a relative clause.</p>

<p id="s-445"><b>445.</b> An indirect question is sometimes expressed by means
of an interrogative pronoun or adverb followed by an infinitive.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Whom to choose</i> is a serious question. [Direct question: Whom shall
  we choose?]</li>

  <li>John asked <i>what to do</i>. [John’s question was: What shall I do?]</li>

  <li>I know <i>where to go</i>. [Direct question: Where shall I go?]</li>

  <li>Tell me <i>when to strike the bell</i>.</li>

  <li>I was at a loss <i>how to reply</i>.</li>

  <li>I am in doubt <i>how to begin this essay</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first four examples the italicized phrase is used as a
noun (either as subject or object). In the fifth, the phrase <i>how
to reply</i> is adverbial, modifying the adjective phrase <i>at a loss</i>.</p>

<p id="s-446"><b>446.</b> The subjunctive was formerly common in indirect questions,
and is still occasionally used after <i>if</i> or <i>whether</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I doubt if it <i>be</i> true.</li>

  <li>Elton questioned whether the project <i>were</i> wise.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-447"><a id="page-182" href="#page-182" class="pagenum" title="182"></a>
<b>447.</b> The rule for <i>shall</i> (<i>should</i>) and <i>will</i> (<i>would</i>) in indirect
questions is, to retain the auxiliary used in the direct question,
merely changing the tense (<i>shall</i> to <i>should</i>; <i>will</i> to <i>would</i>)
when necessary (<a href="#s-442">§&nbsp;442</a>).</p>

<h2>PART THREE<br />

<span class="subtitle">ANALYSIS</span></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subtitle">THE STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES</span></h3>

<p id="s-448"><b>448.</b> <b>Analysis</b> is a Greek word which means “the act of dissolving
or breaking up.” In grammar it is applied to the separation
of a sentence into its constituent parts, or <b>elements</b>. To
dissect a sentence in this way is to <b>analyze</b> it.</p>

<p>The elements which make up a <b>sentence</b> are: (1) the <b>simple
subject</b>; (2) the <b>simple predicate</b>; (3) <b>modifiers</b>; (4) the <b>complements</b>,—direct
object, predicate objective, predicate adjective, predicate
nominative; and (5) the so-called <b>independent elements</b>,—the
interjection, the vocative (or nominative of direct address),
the exclamatory nominative, and various parenthetical expressions
(<a href="#s-501">§&nbsp;501</a>).</p>

<p id="s-449"><b>449.</b> The absolute essentials for a sentence are a <b>substantive
as subject</b> and a <b>verb as predicate</b> (<a href="#s-35">§&nbsp;35</a>). By combining these
two indispensable elements, in various ways, with <b>modifiers</b>
and <b>complements</b>, the sentence may be extended to any length
desired. Indeed, the sole limits are the constructive skill of
the writer and the hearer’s ability to follow the thought without
losing the thread.</p>

<p>In the present chapter, we shall consider how sentences are
built up, or constructed. Our starting point in this study will
be the <b>simple sentence</b>.</p>
<a id="page-184" href="#page-184" class="pagenum" title="184"></a>

<h4>SIMPLE SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-450"><b>450.</b> The following statement is a <b>simple sentence</b>, for it contains
but <b>one subject</b> and <b>one predicate</b> (<a href="#s-46">§&nbsp;46</a>):—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The polar bear | lives in the Arctic regions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The framework or skeleton of this simple sentence consists
of the subject noun <i>bear</i> (the simple subject) and the predicate
verb <i>lives</i> (the simple predicate). To make the <b>complete subject</b>,
<i>bear</i> takes as <b>modifiers</b> the two adjectives <i>the</i> and <i>polar</i>; to
make the <b>complete predicate</b>, <i>lives</i> takes as <b>modifier</b> the adverbial
phrase <i>in the Arctic regions</i>.</p>

<p>By attaching another simple subject to <i>bear</i> we make a
<b>compound subject</b>. Similarly, we make a <b>compound predicate</b> by
adding another verb (<a href="#s-38">§&nbsp;38</a>).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The polar <i>bear</i> and the <i>walrus</i> | <i>live</i> and <i>thrive</i> in the Arctic regions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The compound subject is <i>bear and walrus</i>; the compound
predicate is <i>live and thrive</i>. Both verbs are modified by the
adverbial phrase <i>in the Arctic regions</i>. The sentence itself is
still a simple sentence.</p>

<p>In each of the following simple sentences either the subject
or the predicate or both are compound:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Games and carols closed the busy day.<span class="attribution">—Rogers.</span></li>

  <li>The stars leap forth, and tremble, and retire before the advancing
  moon.<span class="attribution">—George Meredith.</span></li>

  <li>Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows,
  and saw nothing.<span class="attribution">—Dickens.</span></li>

  <li>Work or worry had left its traces upon his thin, yellow face.<span class="attribution">—Doyle.</span></li>

  <li>Crows flutter about the towers and perch on every weathercock.<span class="attribution">—Irving.</span><!--TN: added em dash--></li>

  <li>He gained the door to the landing, pulled it open, and rushed forth.<span class="attribution">—Lytton.</span><!--TN: added em dash--></li>

  <li>Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and
  vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a dense mass.<span class="attribution">—Dickens.</span><!--TN: added em dash--></li>

  <li>There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique plows and the
  harrows.<span class="attribution">—Longfellow.</span></li>

  <li><a id="page-185" href="#page-185" class="pagenum" title="185"></a>
  Both Augustus and Peters joined with him in his design and insisted
  upon its immediately being carried into effect.<span class="attribution">—Poe.</span></li>

  <li>Women and children, from garrets alike and cellars, through infinite
  London, look down or look up with loving eyes upon our gay ribbons
  and our martial laurels.<span class="attribution">—De Quincey.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4>COMPOUND SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-451"><b>451.</b> If we attach another simple sentence to that in <a href="#s-450">§&nbsp;450</a>,
the result is a <b>compound sentence</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The polar bear | lives in the Arctic regions, || but || it | sometimes
reaches temperate latitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is manifestly a <b>compound sentence</b>, for it consists of two
<b>coördinate clauses</b>, joined by the conjunction <i>but</i> (<a href="#s-46">§&nbsp;46</a>).</p>

<p>The framework of the second clause consists of the subject
<i>it</i> and the simple predicate <i>reaches</i>. To make the complete
predicate, the verb <i>reaches</i> takes not only a modifier (the
adverb <i>sometimes</i>), but a <b>complement</b>,—the direct object <i>latitudes</i>,
which completes the meaning of the verb. This noun is
itself modified by the adjective <i>temperate</i>. Both clauses are
<b>simple</b>, for each contains but one subject and one predicate.</p>

<p id="s-452"><b>452.</b> Obviously, almost any number of simple sentences may
be joined (with or without conjunctions) to make one compound
sentence.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p class="verse">The quiet August noon has come;<br />
<span class="i2">A slumberous silence fills the sky;<br /></span>
The fields are still, the woods are dumb,<br />
<span class="i2">In glassy sleep the waters lie.<span class="attribution">—Bryant.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="example">
  <li>States fall, arts fade, but Nature does not die.<span class="attribution">—Byron.</span></li>

  <li>The court was sitting; the case was heard; the judge had finished;
  and only the verdict was yet in arrear.<span class="attribution">—De Quincey.</span></li>

  <li>He softly blushed; he sighed; he hoped; he feared; he doubted; he
  sometimes yielded to the delightful idea.<span class="attribution">—Thackeray.</span></li>

  <li>A mob appeared before the window, a smart rap was heard at the
  door, the boys hallooed, and the maid announced Mr. Grenville.<span class="attribution">—Cowper.</span></li>

  <li>His health had suffered from confinement; his high spirit had been
  cruelly wounded; and soon after his liberation he died of a broken heart.<span class="attribution">—Macaulay.</span><!--TN: added em dash--></li>
</ul>
<a id="page-186" href="#page-186" class="pagenum" title="186"></a>

<h4>COMPLEX SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-453"><b>453.</b> The simple sentence in <a href="#s-450">§&nbsp;450</a> may be made <b>complex</b> by
means of a <b>subordinate clause</b> used as a <b>modifier</b> (<a href="#s-47">§&nbsp;47</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The polar bear, <i>which lives in the Arctic regions</i>, sometimes reaches
  temperate latitudes.</li>

  <li>The polar bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes <i>when the ice drifts
  southward</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first example, the simple subject (<i>bear</i>), besides its two
adjective modifiers (<i>the</i> and <i>polar</i>), takes a third, the adjective
clause <i>which lives in the Arctic regions</i> (<a href="#s-47">§&nbsp;47</a>). The sentence,
then, is <b>complex</b>: the main clause is <i>the polar bear sometimes
reaches temperate latitudes</i>; the subordinate clause is <i>which
lives in the Arctic regions</i>.</p>

<p>The second sentence is also complex. The main clause is
the same as in the first (<i>the polar bear sometimes reaches temperate
latitudes</i>). The subordinate clause is <i>when the ice drifts
southward</i>, an <b>adverbial modifier</b> of the predicate verb <i>reaches</i>.</p>

<h4>COMPOUND AND COMPLEX CLAUSES</h4>

<p id="s-454"><b>454.</b> Two or more <b>coördinate clauses</b> may be joined to make
one <b>compound clause</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The polar bear, <i>which lives in the Arctic regions and whose physical constitution
  is wonderfully adapted to that frigid climate</i>, sometimes reaches
  temperate latitudes.</li>
  <li>The polar bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes <i>when the floes
  break up and when the ice drifts southward</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first example, the italicized words form a <b>compound
adjective clause</b>, modifying the noun <i>bear</i>. It consists of two
<b>coördinate adjective clauses</b> joined by <i>and</i>. These clauses are
coördinate because they are of the same <b>order</b> or <b>rank</b> in the
sentence (<a href="#s-46">§&nbsp;46</a>), each being (if taken singly) an adjective
modifier of the noun.</p>

<p>In the second example, the predicate verb <i>reaches</i> is modified
by a <b>compound adverbial clause</b>, similarly made up.</p>

<p id="s-455"><a id="page-187" href="#page-187" class="pagenum" title="187"></a>
<b>455.</b> A clause is <b>complex</b> when it contains a modifying clause.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The polar bear, <i>which lives in the Arctic regions when it is at home</i>,
sometimes reaches temperate latitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the <b>adjective clause</b> <i>which lives in the Arctic regions
when it is at home</i> is <b>complex</b>, for it contains the adverbial
clause <i>when it is at home</i>, modifying the verb <i>lives</i>.</p>

<h4>COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-456"><b>456.</b> Two or more independent complex clauses may be
joined to make a <b>compound complex sentence</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The brown bear, of which there are several varieties, is common in
the temperate regions of the Eastern Hemisphere; || and || the polar bear
sometimes reaches temperate latitudes when the ice drifts southward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a <b>compound complex sentence</b>, for it consists of two
complex clauses joined by the coördinate conjunction <i>and</i>.
Each of these two clauses is independent of the other, for
each might stand by itself as a complex sentence.</p>

<p>The first complex clause contains an adjective clause, <i>of
which there are several varieties</i>, modifying <i>bear</i>; the second
contains an adverbial clause, <i>when the ice drifts southward</i>,
modifying <i>reaches</i>.</p>

<p id="s-457"><b>457.</b> A sentence consisting of two or more independent
clauses is also classed as a compound complex sentence if any
one of these is complex.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The brown bear is common in the temperate regions of the Eastern
  Hemisphere; || and || the polar bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes
  when the ice drifts southward.</li>
  <li>The brown bear, of which there are several varieties, is common in
  the temperate regions of the Eastern Hemisphere; || and || the polar
  bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these are compound complex sentences. In one, the
first clause is simple (<a href="#s-451">§&nbsp;451</a>) and the second is complex. In the
other, the first clause is complex and the second is simple.</p>

<span class="subtitle">ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES</span></h3>

<h4>SIMPLE SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-458"><b>458.</b> In analyzing a <b>simple sentence</b>, we first divide it into
the <b>complete subject</b> and the <b>complete predicate</b>. Then we point
out the <b>simple subject</b> with its <b>modifiers</b>, and the <b>simple predicate</b>
with its <b>modifiers</b> and <b>complement</b> (if there is one). If either the
subject or the predicate is compound, we mention the simple
subjects or predicates that are joined.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>1. The polar bear lives in the Arctic regions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This is a simple sentence. The complete subject is <i>the polar bear</i>; the
complete predicate is <i>lives in the Arctic regions</i>. The simple subject is
the noun <i>bear</i>; the simple predicate is the verb <i>lives</i>. <i>Bear</i> is modified
by the adjectives <i>the</i> and <i>polar</i>; <i>lives</i> is modified by the adverbial phrase
<i>in the Arctic regions</i>. This phrase consists of the preposition <i>in</i>; its
object, the noun <i>regions</i>; and the adjectives <i>the</i> and <i>Arctic</i>, modifying
<i>regions</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>2. The polar bear and the walrus live and thrive in the Arctic regions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
The complete subject is <i>the polar bear and the walrus</i>. Two simple
subjects (<i>bear</i> and <i>walrus</i>) are joined by the conjunction <i>and</i> to make a
compound subject, and two simple predicates (<i>live</i> and <i>thrive</i>) are joined
by <i>and</i> to make a compound predicate. <i>Live</i> and <i>thrive</i> are both modified
by the adverbial phrase <i>in the Arctic regions</i>.</p>

<h4>COMPOUND SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-459"><b>459.</b> In analyzing a <b>compound sentence</b> we first divide it into
its <b>coördinate clauses</b>, and then analyze each clause by itself.
Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The polar bear lives in the Arctic regions, but it sometimes reaches
temperate latitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This is a compound sentence consisting of two coördinate clauses joined
by the conjunction <i>but</i>: (1) <i>the polar bear lives in the Arctic regions</i> and
(2) <i>it sometimes reaches temperate latitudes</i>. The complete subject of the
<a id="page-189" href="#page-189" class="pagenum" title="189"></a>
first clause is <i>the polar bear</i> [and so on, as in <a href="#s-458">§&nbsp;458</a>, above]. The subject of the
second clause is <i>it</i>; the complete predicate is <i>sometimes reaches temperate
latitudes</i>. The simple predicate is <i>reaches</i>, which is modified by the adverb
<i>sometimes</i> and is completed by the direct object <i>latitudes</i>. The complement
<i>latitudes</i> is modified by the adjective <i>temperate</i>.</p>

<h4>COMPLEX SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-460"><b>460.</b> In analyzing a <b>complex sentence</b>, we first divide it into
the <b>main clause</b> and the <b>subordinate clause</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>1. The polar bear, which lives in the Arctic regions, sometimes reaches
temperate latitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This is a complex sentence. The main clause is <i>the polar bear sometimes
reaches temperate latitudes</i>; the subordinate clause is <i>which lives in
the Arctic regions</i>. The complete subject of the sentence is <i>the polar bear,
which lives in the Arctic regions</i>; the complete predicate is <i>sometimes
reaches temperate latitudes</i>. The simple subject is <i>bear</i>, which is modified
by the adjectives <i>the</i> and <i>polar</i> and by the adjective clause <i>which lives in the
Arctic regions</i>. The simple predicate is <i>reaches</i>, which is modified by the
adverb <i>sometimes</i> and completed by the direct object <i>latitudes</i>. This complement,
<i>latitudes</i>, is modified by the adjective <i>temperate</i>. The subordinate
clause is introduced by the relative pronoun <i>which</i>. [Then analyze the
subordinate clause.]</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>2. The polar bear reaches temperate latitudes when the ice drifts
southward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This is a complex sentence. The main clause is <i>the polar bear reaches
temperate latitudes</i>; the subordinate clause is <i>when the ice drifts southward</i>.
The complete subject of the sentence is <i>the polar bear</i>; the complete
predicate is <i>reaches temperate latitudes when the ice drifts southward</i>. The
simple subject is <i>bear</i>, which is modified by the adjectives <i>the</i> and <i>polar</i>.
The simple predicate is <i>reaches</i>, which is modified by the adverbial clause
<i>when the ice drifts southward</i>, and completed by the noun <i>latitudes</i> (the
direct object of <i>reaches</i>). The complement <i>latitudes</i> is modified by the
adjective <i>temperate</i>. The subordinate clause is introduced by the relative
adverb <i>when</i>. [Then analyze the subordinate clause.]</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>3. The polar bear, which lives in the Arctic regions when it is at
home, sometimes reaches temperate latitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This is a complex sentence. The main clause is <i>the polar bear sometimes
reaches temperate latitudes</i>; the subordinate clause is <i>which lives in
the Arctic regions when it is at home</i>, which is complex, since it contains
the adverbial clause <i>when it is at home</i>, modifying the verb <i>lives</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><a id="page-190" href="#page-190" class="pagenum" title="190"></a>
4. He says that the polar bear lives in the Arctic regions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This is a complex sentence. The main clause is <i>he says</i>; the subordinate
clause is <i>that the polar bear lives in the Arctic regions</i>. The subject of the sentence
is <i>he</i>, the complete predicate is <i>says that the polar bear lives in the Arctic
regions</i>. The simple predicate is <i>says</i>, which is completed by its direct object,
the noun clause <i>that ... regions</i>, introduced by the conjunction <i>that</i>. [Then
analyze the subordinate clause.]</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>5. That the polar bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes is a
familiar fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This is a complex sentence. The main clause (<i>is a familiar fact</i>) appears as
a predicate only, since the subordinate clause (<i>that the polar bear sometimes
reaches temperate latitudes</i>) is a noun clause used as the complete subject of
the sentence. The simple predicate is <i>is</i>, which is completed by the predicate
nominative <i>fact</i>. This complement is modified by the adjectives <i>a</i> and <i>familiar</i>.
The subordinate clause, which is used as the complete subject, is introduced
by the conjunction <i>that</i>. [Then analyze this clause.]</p>

<h4>COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-461"><b>461.</b> In analyzing a <b>compound complex</b> sentence, we first
divide it into the <b>independent clauses</b> (simple or complex) of
which it consists, and then analyze each of these as if it
were a sentence by itself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subtitle">MODIFIERS</span></h3>

<p id="s-462"><b>462.</b> The various kinds of <b>modifiers</b> and <b>complements</b> have
all been studied in preceding chapters,—each in connection
with the construction which it illustrates. For purposes of
analysis, however, it is necessary to consider modifiers as such
and complements as such.</p>

<p>The topics will be taken up in the following order:—(1) modifiers,—of
the subject, of the predicate; (2) complements;
(3) modifiers of complements; (4) modifiers of modifiers.</p>

<p id="s-463"><b>463.</b> <b>A word or group of words that changes or modifies the meaning
of another word is called a modifier</b> (<a href="#s-19">§&nbsp;19</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{Men | <i>Able</i> men | Men <i>of ability</i>} can always find employment.</li>
  <li>{Walls | <i>Battlemented</i> walls | Walls <i>with battlements</i>} usually enclosed mediæval cities.</li>
  <li>{Cottages | <i>English</i> cottages | Cottages <i>in England</i>} are often thatched.</li>
  <li>The boy listened {<i>eagerly</i>. | <i>with eagerness</i>.}</li>
  <li>I coughed {<i>purposely</i>. | <i>on purpose</i>.}</li>
  <li>The bullet passed {<i>harmlessly</i>. | <i>without doing harm</i>.}</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-464"><b>464.</b> Modifiers may be attached not only to substantives
and verbs, but also to adjectives and adverbs.</p>

<p>All modifiers of substantives are called <b>adjective modifiers</b>; all
modifiers of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are called <b>adverbial
modifiers</b>.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="page-192" href="#page-192" class="pagenum" title="192"></a>
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> The terms <b>adjective modifier</b> and <b>adjective</b> are not synonymous. All
adjectives are adjective modifiers, but all adjective modifiers are not adjectives.
Thus, in “Henry’s skates are rusty,” the possessive noun <i>Henry’s</i> is
an adjective modifier, since it limits the noun <i>skates</i> as an adjective might do.</p>

<p id="s-465"><b>465.</b> A group of words used as a modifier may be either a
<b>phrase</b> or a <b>clause</b> (<a href="#s-40">§§&nbsp;40–46</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{<i>Able</i> men | Men <i>of ability</i> | Men <i>who have ability</i>} can always find employment.</li>
  <li>I spoke {<i>thoughtlessly</i>. | <i>without thinking</i>. | <i>before I thought</i>.}</li>
</ul>

<p><b>A phrase or a clause used as an adjective modifier is called an adjective
phrase or clause.</b></p>

<p><b>A phrase or a clause used as an adverbial modifier is called an adverbial
phrase or clause.</b></p>

<p>Adjective and adverbial clauses are always <b>subordinate</b>, because
they are used as parts of speech (<a href="#s-46">§&nbsp;46</a>).</p>

<h4>MODIFIERS OF THE SUBJECT</h4>

<p id="s-466"><b>466.</b> Any substantive in the sentence may take an adjective
modifier, but <b>modifiers of the subject</b> are particularly important.</p>

<p>The simple subject may be modified by (1) an <b>adjective</b>, an
<b>adjective phrase</b>, or an <b>adjective clause</b>; (2) a <b>participle</b>; (3) an
<b>infinitive</b>; (4) a <b>possessive</b>; (5) an <b>appositive</b>.</p>

<h5>I. ADJECTIVES, ADJECTIVE PHRASES, ADJECTIVE CLAUSES</h5>

<p id="s-467"><b>467.</b> The simple subject may be modified by an <b>adjective</b>, an
<b>adjective phrase</b>, or an <b>adjective clause</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>{<i>Ivory</i> trinkets | Trinkets <i>of ivory</i> | Trinkets <i>which were carved from ivory</i>} lay scattered about.</li>
  <li>{<i>Treeless</i> spots | Spots <i>without trees</i> | Spots <i>where no trees grew</i>} were plainly visible.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-193" href="#page-193" class="pagenum" title="193"></a>
In each of these groups of sentences, the subject of the first
sentence is modified by an <b>adjective</b>, that of the second by an
<b>adjective phrase</b>, that of the third by an <b>adjective clause</b>.</p>

<p>Most adjective phrases are <b>prepositional</b> (<a href="#s-42">§&nbsp;42</a>), as in the
examples.</p>

<p id="s-468"><b>468.</b> An <b>adjective clause</b> may be introduced by a <b>relative pronoun</b>
or a <b>relative adverb</b>. For lists, see <a href="#s-377">§&nbsp;377</a>.</p>

<h6>I. Relative Pronouns</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The architect <i>who designed this church</i> was a man of genius.</li>

  <li>The painter <i>whom Ruskin oftenest mentions</i> is Turner.</li>

  <li>A piece of amber <i>which is rubbed briskly</i> will attract bits of paper.</li>

  <li>The day <i>that I dreaded</i> came at last.</li>

  <li>The plain <i>through which this river flows</i> is marvelously fertile.</li>

  <li>The book <i>from which I got this information</i> is always regarded as
  authoritative.</li>

  <li>A friend <i>in whom one can trust</i> is a treasure beyond price.</li>

  <li>The boys <i>with whom he associates</i> do him no good.</li>
</ul>

<h6>II. Relative Adverbs</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The spot <i>where the Old Guard made their last stand</i> is marked by a
  bronze eagle.</li>

  <li>The morning <i>when I arrived in Rome</i> is one of my pleasantest memories.</li>

  <li>The year <i>after Ashton left home</i> brought fresh disaster.</li>

  <li>The land <i>whence Scyld drifted in his magic boat</i> will never be known.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> A preposition and a relative pronoun may often replace a relative
adverb. Thus, in the second example, <i>on which</i> might be substituted for <i>when</i>.</p>

<h5>II. PARTICIPLES</h5>

<p id="s-469"><b>469.</b> The subject may be modified by a <b>participle</b> (with or
without modifier or complement).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. <i>Smiling</i>, the child shook his head.</li>
  <li>2. My aunt, <i>reassured</i>, took up her book again.</li>
  <li>3. The prisoner sank back <i>exhausted</i>.</li>
  <li>4. <i>Exasperated</i> beyond endurance, the captain cut the rope.</li>
  <li>5. John, <i>obeying</i> a sudden impulse, took to his heels.</li>
  <li><a id="page-194" href="#page-194" class="pagenum" title="194"></a>6. <i>Having broken</i> one oar, Robert had to scull.</li>
  <li>7. The natives, <i>fearing</i> captivity above all things, leaped into the river.</li>
  <li>8. Albert left the room, <i>looking</i> rather sullen.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the fourth example the participle is modified by an adverbial
phrase; in the fifth and sixth, it has an object; in the
seventh, it has both an object and a modifier; in the eighth,
it is followed by the predicate adjective <i>sullen</i>. In analysis,
the whole participial phrase (consisting of the participle and
accompanying words) may be treated as an adjective phrase
modifying the subject; but it is simpler to regard the participle
as the modifier, and then to enumerate its modifiers,
etc., separately.</p>

<p class="note">
Thus, in the seventh example, the simple subject <i>natives</i> is modified by
the participle <i>fearing</i>, which has for a complement <i>captivity</i> (the direct
object) and is modified by the adverbial phrase <i>above all things</i>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> A participle, though a modifier of the subject, has at the same time
a peculiar relation to the predicate, because it may take the place of an adverbial
clause. Thus, in the seventh example, <i>fearing</i> is practically equivalent to
the clause <i>because they feared</i>, which, if substituted for the participle, would
of course modify the predicate verb <i>leaped</i>. This dual office of the participle
comes from its twofold nature as (1) an adjective and (2) a verb. In analyzing,
we treat the participle as an adjective modifier of the noun to which it belongs;
but its function as a substitute for an adverbial clause is an important
means of securing variety in style.</p>

<h5>III. INFINITIVES</h5>

<p id="s-470"><b>470.</b> The subject may be modified by an <b>infinitive</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Eagerness <i>to learn</i> was young Lincoln’s strongest passion.</li>

  <li>Desire <i>to travel</i> made Taylor restless.</li>

  <li>The wish <i>to succeed</i> prompted him to do his best.</li>

  <li>Ability <i>to write rapidly</i> is a valuable accomplishment.</li>

  <li>Howard’s unwillingness <i>to desert a friend</i> cost him his life.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the fourth example, the infinitive has an adverbial modifier
(<i>rapidly</i>); and in the fifth, it has a complement, its object
(<i>friend</i>). In such instances, two methods of analysis are allowable,
as in the case of participial phrases (<a href="#s-469">§&nbsp;469</a>).</p>
<a id="page-195" href="#page-195" class="pagenum" title="195"></a>

<h5>IV. POSSESSIVES</h5>

<p id="s-471"><b>471.</b> The subject may be modified by a substantive in the
<b>possessive case</b>.</p>

<p>Such a substantive may be called a <b>possessive modifier</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Napoleon’s</i> tomb is in Paris.</li>

  <li>A <i>man’s</i> house is his castle.</li>

  <li><i>One’s</i> taste in reading changes as one grows older.</li>

  <li>A <i>moment’s</i> thought would have saved me.</li>

  <li>The <i>squirrel’s</i> teeth grow rapidly.</li>

  <li>The <i>Indians’</i> camp was near the river.</li>

  <li><i>His</i> name is Alfred.</li>

  <li><i>Your</i> carriage has arrived.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these examples, a substantive in the possessive
case modifies the subject by limiting its meaning precisely as
an adjective would do.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> An adjective phrase may often be substituted for a possessive.
Thus, in the first example, instead of “<i>Napoleon’s</i> tomb” one may say “the
tomb <i>of Napoleon</i>” (<a href="#s-93">§&nbsp;93</a>).</p>

<h5>V. APPOSITIVES</h5>

<p id="s-472"><b>472.</b> The subject may be modified by a <b>substantive in apposition</b>
(<a href="#s-88-5">§&nbsp;88, 5</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Meredith the <i>carpenter</i> lives in that house.</li>

  <li>Herbert, our <i>captain</i>, has broken his leg.</li>

  <li>The idol of the Aztecs, a grotesque <i>image</i>, was thrown down by the
  Spaniards.</li>

  <li>Many books, both <i>pamphlets</i> and bound <i>volumes</i>, littered the table.
  [Here the subject (<i>books</i>) is modified by two appositives.]</li>
</ul>

<p>Appositives often have modifiers of their own.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Thus <i>carpenter</i> is modified by the adjective <i>the</i>, <i>captain</i> by the possessive
<i>our</i>, <i>image</i> by the adjectives <i>a</i> and <i>grotesque</i>.</p>

<p>In analyzing, the whole appositive phrase (consisting of the appositive and
attached words) may be regarded as modifying the subject. It is as well,
however, to treat the appositive as the modifier and then to enumerate the
adjectives, etc., by which the appositive itself is modified.</p>
</div>

<p id="s-473"><a id="page-196" href="#page-196" class="pagenum" title="196"></a>
<b>473.</b> A <b>noun clause</b> may be used as an appositive, and so
may be an adjective modifier (<a href="#s-386">§&nbsp;386</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The question <i>whether Antonio was a citizen</i> was settled in the affirmative.
  [Here the italicized clause is used as a noun in apposition with
  <i>question</i>.]</li>

  <li>The statement <i>that water freezes</i> seems absurd to a native of the torrid
  zone. [The clause <i>that water freezes</i> is in apposition with <i>statement</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
An adjective in the appositive position is often called an <b>appositive adjective</b>
(<a href="#s-172">§&nbsp;172</a>). “A sword, <i>keen</i> and <i>bright</i>, flashed from the soldier’s scabbard.”</p>

<h4>MODIFIERS OF THE PREDICATE</h4>

<p id="s-474"><b>474.</b> The <b>simple predicate</b>, being a verb or verb-phrase, can
have only <b>adverbial modifiers</b>.</p>

<p>The simple predicate may be modified by (1) an <b>adverb</b>, an
<b>adverbial phrase</b>, or an <b>adverbial clause</b>, (2) an <b>infinitive</b>, (3) an
<b>adverbial objective</b>, (4) a <b>nominative absolute</b>, (5) an <b>indirect object</b>,
(6) a <b>cognate object</b>.</p>

<h5>I. ADVERB, ADVERBIAL PHRASE, ADVERBIAL CLAUSE</h5>

<p id="s-475"><b>475.</b> The simple predicate may be modified by an <b>adverb</b>,
an <b>adverbial phrase</b>, or an <b>adverbial clause</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The landlord collects his rents {<i>monthly</i>. | <i>on the first of every month</i>. | <i>when the first of the month comes</i>.}</li>
  <li>The old schoolhouse stands {<i>there</i>. | <i>at the cross-roads</i>. | <i>where the roads meet</i>.}</li>
  <li>We left the hall {<i>early</i>. | <i>before the last speech</i>. | <i>while the last speech was being delivered</i>.}</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these groups, the simple predicate of the first
sentence is modified by an adverb, that of the second by an
adverbial phrase, and that of the third by an adverbial clause.</p>

<p>Most adverbial phrases are <b>prepositional</b> (<a href="#s-42">§&nbsp;42</a>).</p>

<p id="s-476"><b>476.</b> An adverbial clause that modifies a verb may be introduced
by (1) a <b>relative adverb</b>, or (2) a <b>subordinate conjunction</b>.</p>

<h6>I. Relative Adverbs</h6>

<ul class="example">

  <li>The prisoner has not been seen <i>since he made his escape</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h6>II. Subordinate Conjunctions</h6>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Archer resigned <i>because his health failed</i>.</li>

  <li>I will give the address <i>if you will let me choose my subject</i>.</li>

</ul>

<h5>II. INFINITIVE</h5>

<p id="s-477"><b>477.</b> The simple predicate may be modified by an <b>infinitive</b>
(<a href="#s-323">§&nbsp;323</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He lay down <i>to rest</i>.</li>

  <li>I stopped <i>to listen</i>.</li>

  <li>That draughtsman seems <i>to be</i> remarkably skilful.</li>
</ul>

<p>The infinitive may have a complement or a modifier, as in
the last four examples.</p>

<h5>III. ADVERBIAL OBJECTIVE</h5>

<p id="s-478"><b>478.</b> The simple predicate may be modified by an <b>adverbial
objective</b> (<a href="#s-109">§&nbsp;109</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I have waited <i>ages</i>.</li>

  <li>We have walked <i>miles</i>.</li>

  <li>He stayed <i>a whole day</i>.</li>

  <li>I will forgive you <i>this time</i>.</li>

  <li>The wind blew <i>all night</i>.</li>

  <li>Come with me <i>a little way</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the adverbial phrase <i>the entire distance</i>
modifies the verb <i>ran</i> as an adverb would do. This phrase
consists of the noun <i>distance</i> with its adjective modifiers, <i>the</i>
and <i>entire</i>.</p>

<h5>IV. NOMINATIVE ABSOLUTE</h5>

<p id="s-479"><b>479.</b> The simple predicate may be modified by a <b>nominative
absolute</b> (<a href="#s-345">§&nbsp;345</a>).</p>

<p>A substantive in the <b>absolute construction</b> makes with its
modifiers an adverbial phrase.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>The ship having arrived</i>, we all embarked.</li>

  <li>We shall sail on Tuesday, <i>weather permitting</i>.</li>

  <li><i>That done</i>, repair to Pompey’s theatre.</li>

  <li><i>The bridge across the chasm being only a single tree trunk</i>, we hesitated
  to attempt the passage.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-199" href="#page-199" class="pagenum" title="199"></a>
In the first sentence, the adverbial absolute phrase, <i>the ship
having arrived</i>, is equivalent to the adverbial prepositional
phrase, <i>on the arrival of the ship</i>, and defines the time of the
action expressed by the verb <i>embarked</i>.</p>

<h5>V. INDIRECT OBJECT</h5>

<p id="s-480"><b>480.</b> The simple predicate may be modified by an <b>indirect
object</b> (<a href="#s-105">§&nbsp;105</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>He gave <i>me</i> a watch. [= He gave a watch <i>to me</i>.]</li>

  <li>Tom told <i>me</i> the whole story. [= Tom told the whole story <i>to me</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, the indirect object <i>me</i>, being equivalent
to a prepositional phrase, is an adverbial modifier.</p>

<p class="note">
The objective of service (<a href="#s-106">§&nbsp;106</a>) is also an adverbial modifier.</p>

<h5>VI. COGNATE OBJECT</h5>

<p id="s-481"><b>481.</b> The simple predicate may be modified by a <b>cognate object</b>
or by a phrase containing such an object (<a href="#s-108">§&nbsp;108</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The officer looked <i>daggers</i> at me [= looked at me angrily].</li>

  <li>The shepherd sang a merry <i>song</i> [= sang merrily].</li>

  <li>The skipper laughed a scornful <i>laugh</i> [= laughed scornfully].</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the cognate object (<i>daggers</i>) modifies
the predicate verb (<i>looked</i>) as the adverb <i>angrily</i> would do.
It is therefore an adverbial modifier. In the second and third
sentences the modifier of the predicate verb (<i>sang</i>, <i>laughed</i>) is
an adverbial phrase consisting of a cognate object (<i>song</i>, <i>laugh</i>)
with its adjective modifiers (<i>a merry</i>, <i>a scornful</i>).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subtitle">COMPLEMENTS</span></h3>

<p id="s-482"><b>482.</b> 1. Some verbs have a meaning that is <b>complete in itself</b>.
Such a verb needs only a subject. When this has been supplied,
we have a sentence, for the mere verb, without any
additional word or words, is capable of being a predicate.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Birds <i>fly</i>.</li>
  <li>Fishes <i>swim</i>.</li>
  <li>The sun <i>shines</i>.</li>
  <li>The moon <i>rose</i>.</li>
  <li>The man <i>scowled</i>.</li>
  <li>The girl <i>laughed</i>.</li>
  <li>The owls <i>hooted</i>.</li>
  <li>The clock <i>ticked</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Verbs of this kind are sometimes called <b>complete verbs</b>, or <b>verbs
of complete predication</b>.</p>

<p>2. Other verbs are not, by themselves, capable of serving as
predicates. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The Indians killed ——.</li>
  <li>Mr. Harris makes ——.</li>
  <li>Tom is ——.</li>
  <li>The man seemed ——.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not sentences, for the predicate of each is unfinished.
The verb requires the addition of a substantive or an
adjective to complete its sense.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The Indians killed <i>deer</i>.</li>
  <li>Mr. Harris makes <i>shoes</i>.</li>
  <li>Tom is <i>captain</i>.</li>
  <li>The man seemed <i>sorry</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Verbs of this kind are often called <b>incomplete verbs</b>, or <b>verbs of
incomplete predication</b>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The meaning of the verb determines to which of these classes it
belongs. Accordingly, the same verb may belong to the first class in some of
its senses and to the second in others (<a href="#s-212">§§&nbsp;212–215</a>).</p>

<p id="s-483"><b>483.</b> <b>A substantive or adjective added to the predicate verb to complete
its meaning is called a complement.</b></p>

<p><b>Complements are of four kinds,—the direct object, the predicate
objective, the predicate nominative, and the predicate adjective.</b></p>

<p><a id="page-201" href="#page-201" class="pagenum" title="201"></a>
In the examples in <a href="#s-482">§&nbsp;482</a>, <i>deer</i> and <i>shoes</i> are <b>direct objects</b>,—the
former denoting the <b>receiver</b> of the action, the latter
denoting the <b>product</b>; <i>captain</i> is a <b>predicate nominative</b>, denoting
the same person as the subject <i>Tom</i> (<a href="#s-88-2">§&nbsp;88, 2</a>); <i>sorry</i> is a
predicate adjective describing the subject <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>Complements may, of course, be modified. If they are substantives,
they may take adjective modifiers; if adjectives, they
may take adverbial modifiers (<a href="#s-464">§§&nbsp;464</a>, <a href="#s-494">494</a>).</p>

<p id="s-484"><b>484.</b> For convenience, the definitions of the four kinds of
complements are here repeated, with examples.</p>

<h4>1. THE DIRECT OBJECT</h4>

<p id="s-485"><b>485.</b> <b>Some verbs may be followed by a substantive denoting that
which receives the action or is produced by it. These are called transitive
verbs. All other verbs are called intransitive.</b></p>

<p><b>A substantive that completes the meaning of a transitive verb is called
its direct object</b> (<a href="#s-100">§&nbsp;100</a>).</p>

<p class="note">
The direct object is often called the <b>object complement</b>, or merely the <b>object
of the verb</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Alfred has broken his <i>arm</i>.</li>
  <li>Morse invented the electric <i>telegraph</i>.</li>
  <li>Black foxes command a high <i>price</i>.</li>
  <li>You have accomplished a <i>task</i> of great difficulty.</li>
  <li>Have you lost the <i>dog</i> which your uncle gave you?</li>
  <li>He asked <i>me</i> the <i>news</i>. [Two direct objects (<a href="#s-103">§&nbsp;103</a>).]</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these objects are modified,—<i>arm</i> by the possessive
<i>his</i>; <i>telegraph</i> by <i>the</i> and <i>electric</i>; <i>price</i> by <i>a</i> and <i>high</i>; <i>task</i>
by the adjective phrase <i>of great difficulty</i>; <i>dog</i> by <i>the</i> and by
the adjective clause <i>which your uncle gave you</i>.</p>

<p id="s-486"><b>486.</b> A noun clause may be used as the direct object of a
verb (<a href="#s-386">§&nbsp;386</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You promised <i>that my coat should be ready to-day</i>.</li>
  <li>The mayor ordered <i>that the street should be closed for three hours</i>.</li>
  <li>I begged <i>that my passport might be returned to me</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For further examples, see <a href="#s-407">§§&nbsp;407</a>, <a href="#s-432">432</a>, <a href="#s-439">439</a>, <a href="#s-441">441</a>.</p>
<a id="page-202" href="#page-202" class="pagenum" title="202"></a>

<h4>2. THE PREDICATE OBJECTIVE</h4>

<p id="s-487"><b>487.</b> <b>Verbs of <i>choosing</i>, <i>calling</i>, <i>naming</i>, <i>making</i>, and <i>thinking</i> may take
two objects referring to the same person or thing.</b></p>

<p><b>The first of these is the direct object, and the second, which completes
the sense of the predicate, is called a predicate objective</b> (<a href="#s-104">§&nbsp;104</a>).</p>

<p class="note">
The <b>predicate objective</b> is often called the <b>complementary object</b> or the
<b>objective attribute</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The people have elected Chamberlain <i>governor</i>.</li>

  <li>Peter calls Richard my <i>shadow</i>.</li>

  <li>The court has appointed you the child’s <i>guardian</i>.</li>

  <li>John thinks himself a <i>hero</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-488"><b>488.</b> An <b>adjective</b> may serve as a <b>predicate objective</b>. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I thought your decision <i>hasty</i>.<!--TN: added period--></li>

  <li>I call that answer <i>impertinent</i>.</li>

  <li>The jury found the prisoner <i>guilty</i>.</li>

  <li>Your letter made him <i>joyful</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Care should be taken not to confuse adverbs with adjectives
in <i>-ly</i> serving as predicate objectives.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You called him <i>sickly</i>. [Adjective.]</li>

  <li>You called him <i>early</i>. [Adverb.]</li>
</ul>

<p>After the passive, a predicate objective becomes a <b>predicate
nominative</b> (<a href="#s-489">§&nbsp;489</a>).</p>

<h4>3. THE PREDICATE NOMINATIVE</h4>

<p id="s-489"><b>489.</b> <b>A substantive standing in the predicate, but describing or defining
the subject, agrees with the subject in case and is called a predicate
nominative</b> (<a href="#s-88-2">§&nbsp;88, 2</a>).</p>

<p class="note">
A predicate nominative is often called a <b>subject complement</b> or an <b>attribute</b>.</p>

<p>The predicate nominative is common after <i>is</i> and other copulative
verbs, and after certain transitive verbs in the passive voice.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Chemistry is a useful <i>science</i>.</li>
  <li>Boston is the <i>capital</i> of Massachusetts.</li>
  <li>Jefferson became <i>President</i>.</li>
  <li><a id="page-203" href="#page-203" class="pagenum" title="203"></a>This bird is called a <i>flamingo</i>.</li>
  <li>Mr. Hale was appointed <i>secretary</i>.</li>
  <li>Albert has been chosen <i>captain</i> of the crew.</li>
  <li>You are a <i>friend</i> upon whom I can rely.</li>
</ul>

<p>In most of the examples, the predicate nominative has one
or more modifiers. In the first sentence, <i>science</i> is modified by
the two adjectives <i>a</i> and <i>useful</i>; in the second, <i>capital</i> is modified
by the adjective phrase <i>of Massachusetts</i>; in the last,
<i>friend</i> is modified by the adjective clause <i>upon whom I can rely</i>.</p>

<p>For the distinction between the <b>predicate nominative</b> and the
<b>direct object</b>, see <a href="#s-102">§&nbsp;102</a>.</p>

<p id="s-490"><b>490.</b> A <b>noun clause</b> may be used as a predicate nominative
(<a href="#s-386">§&nbsp;386</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>My plan is <i>that the well should be dug to-morrow</i>.</li>
  <li>His intention was <i>that you should remain here</i>.</li>
  <li>The result is <i>that he is bankrupt</i>.</li>
  <li>Ruth’s fear was <i>that the door might be locked</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-491"><b>491.</b> An <b>infinitive</b> may be used as a predicate nominative.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>To hear is <i>to obey</i>.</li>
  <li>My hope was <i>to reach</i> the summit before dark.</li>
  <li>Their plan was <i>to undermine</i> the tower.</li>
  <li>My habit is <i>to rise</i> early.</li>
</ul>

<p>The infinitive may have a complement or modifiers. In the
second and third examples, it takes an object; in the fourth
it is modified by an adverb.</p>

<h4>4. THE PREDICATE ADJECTIVE</h4>

<p id="s-492"><b>492.</b> <b>An adjective in the predicate belonging to a noun or pronoun in
the subject is called a predicate adjective.</b></p>

<p><b>A predicate adjective completes the meaning of the predicate verb
and is therefore a complement</b> (<a href="#s-172-3">§&nbsp;172, 3</a>.)</p>

<p>Like the predicate nominative, the predicate adjective is
common after copulative verbs and after certain transitive
verbs in the passive voice (<a href="#s-172-3">§§&nbsp;172, 3</a>; <a href="#s-252">252</a>).</p>
<a id="page-204" href="#page-204" class="pagenum" title="204"></a>

<ul class="example">
  <li>John was <i>angry</i>.</li>
  <li>My knife is growing <i>dull</i>.</li>
  <li>The task seemed very <i>easy</i>.</li>
  <li>The report proved <i>false</i> in every particular.</li>
  <li>The boat was thought <i>unsafe</i>.</li>
  <li>The cover was made perfectly <i>tight</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In some of these examples, the predicate adjective has a
modifier. In the third, <i>easy</i> is modified by the adverb <i>very</i>;
in the fourth, <i>false</i> is modified by the adverbial phrase <i>in every
particular</i>; in the last, <i>tight</i> is modified by <i>perfectly</i>.</p>

<p id="s-493"><b>493.</b> An <b>adjective phrase</b> may be used as a predicate adjective.
Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Richard was <i>out of health</i>. [Compare: Richard was <i>ill</i>.]</li>

  <li>Rachel seemed <i>in a passion</i>. [Compare: seemed <i>angry</i>.]</li>

  <li>This act is <i>against my interests</i>. [Compare: is <i>harmful</i> to me.]</li>
</ul>

<p>The adjective phrase may consist of an infinitive with or
without the preposition <i>about</i> (<a href="#s-319">§&nbsp;319</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I was <i>about to speak</i>.</li>

  <li>This house is <i>to let</i>.</li>

  <li>I am <i>to sail</i> to-morrow.</li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">MODIFIERS OF COMPLEMENTS AND OF MODIFIERS</span></h3>

<h4>COMPLEMENTS MODIFIED</h4>

<p id="s-494"><b>494.</b> Complements, being either substantives or adjectives,
may be modified in various ways, most of which have been noted
in <a href="#III-3">Chapter III</a>.</p>

<p>1. A <b>substantive</b> used as a <b>complement</b> may have the same
kinds of modifiers that are used with the <b>subject</b> (<a href="#s-466">§&nbsp;466</a>).</p>

<p>2. An <b>adjective complement</b> admits only <b>adverbial modifiers</b>.</p>

<p id="s-495"><b>495.</b> The following sentences illustrate the modifiers of
substantive complements:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Herbert lost <i>a gold</i> watch. [The direct object (<i>watch</i>) is modified by
  the adjectives <i>a</i> and <i>gold</i>.]</li>

  <li>The duke built towers <i>of marble</i>. [The direct object (<i>towers</i>) is modified
  by the adjective phrase <i>of marble</i>.]</li>

  <li>My father built <i>the</i> house <i>in which I was born</i>. [The direct object
  (<i>house</i>) is modified by the adjective <i>the</i> and the adjective clause <i>in which
  I was born</i>.]</li>

  <li>I saw <i>a</i> man <i>running</i> across the field. [The direct object (<i>man</i>) is
  modified by the adjective <i>a</i> and the participle <i>running</i>.]</li>

  <li>You have forfeited <i>your</i> right <i>to vote</i>. [The direct object (<i>right</i>) is
  modified by the possessive pronoun <i>your</i> and the infinitive <i>to vote</i>.]</li>

  <li>I have seen <i>Henry’s</i> brother. [The direct object (<i>brother</i>) is modified
  by the possessive noun <i>Henry’s</i>.]</li>

  <li>I must ask <i>my</i> brother, the <i>mayor</i>. [The direct object (<i>brother</i>) is
  modified by the possessive pronoun <i>my</i> and the appositive <i>mayor</i>.]</li>

  modified by the adjectives <i>an</i> and <i>old</i>.]</li>

  <li>Her sons are veterans <i>of the Franco-Prussian war</i>. [The predicate
  nominative (<i>veterans</i>) is modified by the adjective phrase <i>of the Franco-Prussian
  war</i>.]</li>

  <li>They are rivals <i>in business</i>. [The predicate nominative (<i>rivals</i>) is
  modified by the adjective phrase <i>in business</i>.]</li>

  <li><a id="page-206" href="#page-206" class="pagenum" title="206"></a>
  The author is Will Jewell, <i>who was formerly editor of</i> “<i>The Pioneer</i>.”
  [The predicate nominative (<i>Will Jewell</i>) is modified by the adjective
  clause <i>who was formerly editor</i>, etc.]</li>

  <li>Baldwin is <i>the</i> man <i>standing</i> under the tree. [The predicate nominative
  (<i>man</i>) is modified by the adjective <i>the</i> and the participle <i>standing</i>.]</li>

  <li>Your chief fault is <i>your</i> inclination <i>to procrastinate</i>. [The predicate
  nominative (<i>inclination</i>) is modified by the possessive pronoun <i>your</i> and
  the infinitive <i>to procrastinate</i>.]</li>

  <li>This man is <i>Gretchen’s</i> brother. [The predicate nominative (<i>brother</i>)
  is modified by the possessive noun <i>Gretchen’s</i>.]</li>

  <li>The first to fall was <i>the</i> bugler, <i>John Wilson</i>. [The predicate nominative
  (<i>bugler</i>) is modified by the adjective <i>the</i> and the appositive
  <i>John Wilson</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-496"><b>496.</b> <b>Adjective clauses</b> are very common as modifiers of substantive
complements (cf. <a href="#s-468">§&nbsp;468</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Have you lost the watch <i>that your cousin gave you</i>?</li>

  <li>This is the very spot <i>where the temple of Saturn stood</i>.</li>

  well</i>.</li>

  <li>We have abundant proof <i>that during his stay on the Continent, Bacon
  did not neglect literary and scientific pursuits</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-497"><b>497.</b> An <b>adjective</b> used as a complement may be modified
by an <b>adverb</b>, an <b>adverbial phrase</b>, or an <b>adverbial clause</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I am <i>very</i> sorry <i>for you</i>. [<i>Sorry</i> is modified by the adverb <i>very</i> and the
  adverbial phrase <i>for you</i>.]</li>

</ul>
<a id="page-207" href="#page-207" class="pagenum" title="207"></a>

<h4>MODIFIERS OF OTHER MODIFIERS</h4>

<p id="s-498"><b>498.</b> <b>Modifiers may themselves be modified.</b></p>

<p>The chief varieties of such modification are illustrated in
the following sentences.</p>

<p>I. <b>Adjectives</b> or <b>adjective phrases</b> may be modified by <b>adverbs</b>
or by words or groups of words used adverbially.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>A <i>very</i> old man came to the door.</li>

  <li>An <i>exceedingly</i> dangerous curve lay beyond the bridge.</li>

  <li>This <i>rather</i> odd proposal interested us.</li>

  <li>The quay is <i>miles</i> long. [Adverbial objective (<a href="#s-109">§&nbsp;109</a>).]</li>

  <li><i>At least</i> five different amendments have been offered. [<i>Five</i> is modified
  by the adverbial phrase <i>at least</i>.]</li>

  <li>The general, <i>wholly</i> in the dark as to the enemy’s intentions, ordered
  an advance. [The adjective phrase <i>in the dark</i> is modified by <i>wholly</i>.]</li>

  <li><i>Quite</i> at his ease, John began to speak. [<i>At his ease</i> is modified by
  <i>quite</i>.]</li>

  <li>Her smile, pathetic <i>in its weariness</i>, quickly faded. [The adverbial
  phrase modifies <i>pathetic</i>]</li>

  <li>This sleeve is <i>a good two inches</i> short. [The phrase modifies <i>short</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p>II. <b>Possessive nouns</b> may be modified by adjectives or by
possessives.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>The poor</i> man’s days are numbered.</li>

  <li><i>Honest</i> Tom’s face shone with delight.</li>

  <li><i>The faithful</i> animal’s head drooped.</li>

  <li><i>My</i> uncle’s barn is on fire.</li>

  <li><i>John’s</i> brother’s name is Reginald.</li>
</ul>

<p>III. <b>Appositives</b> may be modified by adjectives or by groups
of words used as adjectives.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Joe, <i>the old</i> butler, met me at the station.</li>

  <li>Sam, <i>the cunning</i> rascal, had stolen the oars.</li>

  <li>Her mother, a woman <i>of fashion</i>, sadly neglected her.</li>

  <li>The other, the man <i>at the table</i>, laughed rudely.</li>

  <li>Ferdinand Oliver, the engineer <i>who had charge of the construction</i>,
  proved incompetent.</li>

  <li>Two Englishmen, friends <i>whom I visited last summer</i>, are coming to
  New York in December.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-208" href="#page-208" class="pagenum" title="208"></a>
IV. <b>Adverbs</b> or <b>adverbial phrases</b> may be modified by adverbs
or by words or groups of words used adverbially.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Jane plays <i>very</i> well.</li>

  <li>Robert spoke <i>almost</i> hopefully.</li>

  <li>She answered <i>quite</i> at random.</li>

  <li>I write to him <i>at least</i> once <i>a year</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-499"><b>499.</b> An adjective may be modified by an <b>infinitive</b> (<a href="#s-321">§&nbsp;321</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Unable <i>to move</i>, I suffered torments of anxiety.</li>

  <li>The sailors, eager <i>to reach</i> the island, plunged into the sea.</li>

  <li>Reluctant <i>to act</i>, but unwilling <i>to stand</i> idle, Burwell was in a pitiful
  state of indecision.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-500"><b>500.</b> Adjective and adverbial clauses are very common as
modifiers of modifiers (cf. <a href="#s-496">§&nbsp;496</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>Geronimo, an old chief <i>who bore the scars of many battles</i>, led the attack.
  [The adjective clause modifies the appositive <i>chief</i>.]</li>

  <li>The servant, angry <i>because he had been rebuked</i>, slammed the door as
  he went out.</li>

  <li>The hunter, confident <i>that the deer had not heard him</i>, took deliberate
  aim.</li>

  <li>The fugitive, in a panic <i>lest he should be overtaken</i>, made frantic efforts
  to scale the cliff. [The adverbial clause modifies the adjective phrase
  <i>in a panic</i>.]</li>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subtitle">INDEPENDENT ELEMENTS</span></h3>

<p id="s-501"><b>501.</b> <b>A word or group of words that has no grammatical connection
with the sentence in which it stands is called an independent element.</b></p>

<p><b>Independent elements are of four kinds,—interjections, vocatives (or
nominatives by direct address), exclamatory nominatives, and parenthetical
expressions.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Ah!</i> why did I undertake this task?</li>

  <li>Help arrived, <i>alas!</i> too late.</li>

  <li>You are a strange man, <i>Arthur</i>.</li>

  <li><i>Mary</i>, come here!</li>

  <li>Poor <i>Charles</i>! I am sorry for him.</li>

  <li><i>Clothes! clothes!</i> you are always wanting clothes.</li>

  <li>Lucky <i>she</i>! we are all envious of her prospects.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two sentences contain <b>interjections</b> (<a href="#s-372">§&nbsp;372</a>); the
second two, <b>vocatives</b> (or nominatives by direct address)
(<a href="#s-88-3">§&nbsp;88, 3</a>); the last three, <b>exclamatory nominatives</b> (<a href="#s-88-4">§&nbsp;88, 4</a>).</p>

<p>When the independent word has a <b>modifier</b> (as in the fifth
and seventh examples), the whole phrase may be treated as
an independent element.</p>

<p id="s-502"><b>502.</b> <b>A word or group of words attached to or inserted in a sentence
as a mere comment, without belonging either to the subject or the
predicate, is said to be parenthetical.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The market, <i>indeed</i>, was already closed.</li>

  <li>Peter, <i>to be sure</i>, was not very trustworthy.</li>

  <li>The house, <i>at all events</i>, is safe.</li>

  <li>The road is, <i>I admit</i>, very hilly.</li>

  <li>Luttrell’s method, <i>it must be confessed</i>, was a little disappointing.</li>

  <li>Richard was not a bad fellow, <i>after all</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-503"><b>503.</b> In analysis, an independent element is mentioned by
itself, and not as a part of the complete subject or the complete
predicate.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subtitle">COMBINATIONS OF CLAUSES</span></h3>

<p id="s-504"><b>504.</b> The use of subordinate clauses as complements and
modifiers, and as modifiers of complements and of modifiers, may
produce sentences of great length and complicated structure.</p>

<p>Such sentences, if skilfully composed, are not hard to follow.
Their analysis requires merely the intelligent application of a
few simple principles, which have already been explained and
illustrated.</p>

<p id="s-505"><b>505.</b> These principles may be summed up as follows:—</p>

<p>I. All clauses are either <b>independent</b> or <b>subordinate</b>. A clause
is subordinate if it is used as a part of speech (noun, adjective,
or adverb); otherwise, it is independent (<a href="#s-46">§&nbsp;46</a>).</p>

<p>II. <b>Coördinate</b> means “of the same rank” in the sentence
(<a href="#s-46">§&nbsp;46</a>).</p>

<p>1. Two or more <b>independent clauses</b> in the same sentence are
manifestly coördinate.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>The fire blazed</i> and <i>the wood crackled</i>. [Two declarative clauses.]</li>
  <li><i>What is your name</i>, and <i>where were you born</i>? [Interrogative clauses.]</li>
  <li><i>Sit down</i> and <i>tell me your story</i>. [Imperative clauses.]</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Two or more <b>subordinate clauses</b> are coördinate <i>with each
other</i> when they are used together in the same construction,—as
nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.</p>

<p>Such a group may be regarded as forming one <b>compound
subordinate clause</b>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The truth is, <i>that I have no money</i> and <i>that my friends have forsaken
  me</i>. [Noun clauses.]</li>
  <li>The Indians, <i>who were armed with long lances</i>, and <i>who showed great
  skill in using them</i>, made a furious attack on the cavalry. [Adjective
  clauses.]</li>
  <li><i>When he had spoken</i>, but <i>before a vote had been taken</i>, a strange tumult
  was heard in the outer room. [Adverbial clauses.]</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-211" href="#page-211" class="pagenum" title="211"></a>
In the first example, we have a <b>compound noun clause</b>; in the
second, a <b>compound adjective clause</b>; in the third, a <b>compound
adverbial clause</b>.</p>

<p>3. Coördinate clauses are either joined by coördinate conjunctions
(<i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>but</i>, etc.), or such conjunctions may be
supplied without changing the sense (<a href="#s-362">§&nbsp;362</a>).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The good-natured old gentleman, <i>who was friendly to both parties</i>, [<span class="smaller">AND</span>]
<i>who did not lack courage</i>, <span class="smaller">AND</span> <i>who hated a quarrel</i>, spoke his mind with
complete frankness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>III. A subordinate clause may depend on another subordinate
clause.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The horse shied <i>when he saw the locomotive</i>. [The subordinate clause
  depends upon the independent (main) clause.]</li>

  <li>The horse shied when he saw the locomotive, <i>which was puffing violently</i>.
  [The second subordinate clause depends upon the first, being an
  adjective modifier of <i>locomotive</i>.]</li>
</ul>

<p>In such cases, the whole group of subordinate clauses may
be taken together as forming one <b>complex subordinate clause</b>.</p>

<p class="note">
Thus, in the second example, <i>when he saw the locomotive, which was
puffing violently</i> may be regarded as a complex adverbial clause modifying
<i>shied</i>, and containing an adjective clause (<i>which was puffing violently</i>).</p>

<p id="s-506"><b>506.</b> From the principles summarized in <a href="#s-505">§&nbsp;505</a>, it appears
that—</p>

<p><b>Clauses (like sentences) may be simple, compound, or complex.</b></p>

<p>1. A <b>simple clause</b> contains but one subject and one predicate,
either or both of which may be compound (<a href="#s-451">§&nbsp;451</a>).</p>

<p>2. A <b>compound clause</b> consists of two or more coördinate clauses
(<a href="#s-454">§&nbsp;454</a>).</p>

<p>3. A <b>complex clause</b> consists of at least two clauses, one of
which is subordinate to the other.</p>

<p id="s-507"><b>507.</b> The <b>unit</b> in all combinations of clauses is clearly the
<b>simple sentence</b>, which, when used as a part of a more complicated
sentence, becomes a <b>simple clause</b>.</p>

<p><a id="page-212" href="#page-212" class="pagenum" title="212"></a>
The processes used in such combinations, as we have seen,
are really but two in number,—<b>coördination</b> and <b>subordination</b>.</p>

<p><b>Coördination of clauses produces compound sentences or compound
clauses; subordination of one clause to another produces complex sentences
or complex clauses.</b></p>

<p id="s-508"><b>508.</b> Every sentence, however long and complicated, belongs
(in structure) to one of the three classes,—<b>simple</b>, <b>compound</b>,
and <b>complex</b>.</p>

<h4>SIMPLE SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-509"><b>509.</b> A simple sentence may have a <b>compound subject or predicate</b>
(or both), and may also include a number of modifiers and
complements.</p>

<p>Obviously, then, a simple sentence need not be short. It
remains <b>simple in structure</b> so long as it contains but one simple
or compound subject and one simple or compound predicate.
Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>1. You leave Glasgow in a steamboat, go down the Clyde fourteen
miles, and then come to Dumbarton Castle, a huge rock five or six hundred
feet high, not connected with any other high land, and with a
fortress at the top.<span class="attribution">—Webster.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
The length of this sentence is due partly to its compound predicate, partly
to the modifier (and modifiers of the modifier) attached to the noun <i>Dumbarton
Castle</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>2. He was little disposed to exchange his lordly repose for the insecure
and agitated life of a conspirator, to be in the power of accomplices, to
live in constant dread of warrants and king’s messengers, nay, perhaps,
to end his days on a scaffold, or to live on alms in some back street of
the Hague.<span class="attribution">—Macaulay.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This sentence is lengthened by means of a series of infinitives used as
adverbial modifiers of the complement <i>disposed</i> (a participle used as an adjective).
Each of these infinitives takes a complement or a modifier (or both).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>3. The arbitrary measures of Charles I, the bold schemes of Strafford,
and the intolerant bigotry of Laud, precipitated a collision between the
opposite principles of government, and divided the whole country into
Cavaliers and Roundheads.<span class="attribution">—May.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><a id="page-213" href="#page-213" class="pagenum" title="213"></a>
Both the subject and the predicate are compound. Each of the three nouns
in the compound subject has modifiers. The two verbs in the compound
predicate have each a complement, and the second has an adverbial modifier
(a phrase).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>4. Twenty of the savages now got on board and proceeded to ramble
over every part of the deck and scramble about among the rigging, making
themselves much at home and examining every article with great
inquisitiveness.<span class="attribution">—Poe.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
The predicate is compound. The sentence is extended by the use of participles
(<i>making</i> and <i>examining</i>), which modify the simple subject <i>twenty</i>.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>5. She was tumbled early, by accident or design, into a spacious
  closet of good old English reading, without much selection or prohibition,
  and browsed at will upon that fair and wholesome pasturage.<span class="attribution">—Lamb.</span></li>

  <li>6. The mermaid was still seen to glide along the waters, and mingling
  her voice with the sighing breeze, was often heard to sing of subterranean
  wonders, or to chant prophecies of future events.<span class="attribution">—Scott.</span></li>

  <li>7. With early dawn, they were under arms, and, without waiting for
  the movement of the Spaniards, poured into the city and attacked them
  in their own quarters.<span class="attribution">—Prescott.</span></li>

  <li>8. Arming a desperate troop of slaves and gladiators, he overpowered
  the feeble guard of the domestic tranquillity of Rome, received the homage
  of the Senate, and, assuming the title of Augustus, precariously reigned
  during a tumult of twenty-eight days.<span class="attribution">—Gibbon.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> A <b>simple sentence with compound predicate</b> often differs very slightly
from a <b>compound sentence</b>. Thus in examples 4–7 the insertion of a single pronoun
(<i>they</i>, <i>she</i>) to serve as a subject for the second verb (<i>proceeded</i>, <i>browsed</i>,
etc.) will make the sentence compound.</p>

<h4>COMPOUND AND COMPLEX SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-510"><b>510.</b> Every sentence that is not simple must be either
<b>compound</b> or <b>complex</b>.</p>

<p>A sentence is <b>compound</b> if it consists of two or more independent
clauses; <b>complex</b>, if it consists of one independent (main)
clause and one or more subordinate clauses.</p>

<p id="s-511"><b>511.</b> An ordinary <b>compound sentence</b> consists of two or more
coördinate simple clauses.</p>

<p><a id="page-214" href="#page-214" class="pagenum" title="214"></a>
Such a sentence may be of great length (as in the last example
below), but its structure is usually transparent.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>A cricket chirps on the hearth, | and | we are reminded of Christmas
  gambols long ago.<span class="attribution">—Hazlitt.</span></li>

  <li>The moments were numbered; | the strife was finished; | the vision
  was closed.<span class="attribution">—De Quincey.</span></li>

  <li>The old king had retired to his couch that night in one of the strongest
  towers of the Alhambra, | but | his restless anxiety kept him from
  repose.<span class="attribution">—Irving.</span></li>

  <li>The clock has just struck two; | the expiring taper rises and sinks in
  the socket; | the watchman forgets his hour in slumber; | the laborious and
  the happy are at rest; | and | nothing wakes but meditation, guilt, revelry,
  and despair.<span class="attribution">—Goldsmith.</span></li>

  <li>The present, indeed, is not a contest for distant or contingent objects;
  | it is not a contest for acquisition of territory; | it is not a contest for
  power and glory; | as little is it carried on merely for any commercial
  advantage, or any particular form of government; | but | it is a contest
  for the security, the tranquillity, and the very existence of Great Britain,
  connected with that of every established government and every country
  in Europe.<span class="attribution">—Pitt.</span></li>
</ul>

<p id="s-512"><b>512.</b> A <b>complex sentence</b>, in its most elementary form, consists
of one simple independent (main) clause and one simple
subordinate clause.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The gas exploded when I struck a match.</li>

  <li>Though he is idle, he is not lazy.</li>

  <li>The carpenter who fell from the roof has recovered from his injuries.</li>

  <li>Their eyes were so fatigued with the eternal dazzle and whiteness,
  that they lay down on their backs upon deck to relieve their sight on
  the blue sky.<span class="attribution">—Keats.</span></li>

  <li>The shouts of thousands, their menacing gestures, the fierce clashing
  of their arms, astonished and subdued the courage of Vetranio, who
  stood, amidst the defection of his followers, in anxious and silent
  suspense.<span class="attribution">—Gibbon.</span></li>
</ul>

<p id="s-513"><b>513.</b> Both compound sentences and complex sentences admit
of much variety in structure, according to the nature and
the relations of the clauses that compose them.</p>
<a id="page-215" href="#page-215" class="pagenum" title="215"></a>

<h4>COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES</h4>

<p id="s-514"><b>514.</b> <b>Any or all of the coördinate clauses that make up a compound
sentence may be complex. In that case, the sentence is called a compound
complex sentence.</b></p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Compound complex sentences form a special class or subdivision
under the general head of compound sentences.<a href="#footnote-49" id="marker-49" class="marker" title="Footnote 49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Old Uncle Venner was just coming out of his door, with a wood-horse
and saw on his shoulder; and, trudging along the street, he scrupled not
to keep company with Phœbe, so far as their paths lay together; nor, in
spite of his patched coat and rusty beaver, and the curious fashion of his
tow-cloth trousers, could she find it in her heart to outwalk him.<span class="attribution">—Hawthorne.</span><!--TN: added em dash--></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="note">
<p>This sentence consists of <b>three coördinate clauses</b>, each independent of the
others. These are joined by the coördinate conjunctions <i>and</i>, <i>nor</i>. The first
and the third clause are <b>simple</b>, but the second clause is <b>complex</b>. Hence the
whole forms one <b>compound complex sentence</b>.</p>

<p>The complex clause consists of two clauses, the second of which is subordinate
to the first. Taken as a whole, however, this complex clause is manifestly
coördinate with the two simple clauses, since the three form a series
joined by coördinate conjunctions.</p>

<p class="note">
In this sentence <i>they were</i> is understood after <i>till</i>.</p>

<h4>VARIETIES OF THE COMPLEX SENTENCE</h4>

<p id="s-516"><b>516.</b> A complex sentence may be expanded either by compounding
the main clause, or by increasing the number of subordinate
clauses. Both methods may be used in the same
sentence.</p>

<p id="s-517"><b>517.</b> <b>The independent (main) clause of a complex sentence may be
compound.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>When they saw the ship, <i>they shouted for joy and some of them burst
  into tears</i>.</li>

  <li>As they turned down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades, <i>the sun
  dipped and disappeared, and the woods fell instantly into the gravity and
  grayness of the early night</i>.<span class="attribution">—Stevenson.</span></li>

  <li><i>The eye of the young monarch kindled and his dark cheek flushed with
  sudden anger</i>, as he listened to proposals so humiliating.<span class="attribution">—Prescott.</span></li>

  <li><i>Sharpe was so hated in Scotland during his life, and his death won him
  so many friends, or pitying observers</i>, that it is not easy to write of him
  without prejudice or favor.<span class="attribution">—A. Lang.</span></li>

  <li>As has been the case with many another good fellow of his nation, <i>his
  life was tracked and his substance wasted by crowds of hungry beggars and
  lazy dependents</i>.<span class="attribution">—Thackeray.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-217" href="#page-217" class="pagenum" title="217"></a>
Note that the subordinate clause depends on the compound
main clause, not upon either of its members.</p>

<p class="note">
Thus, in the first example, the subordinate clause (<i>when they saw the
ship</i>) depends upon the compound main clause, <i>they shouted for joy and
some of them burst into tears</i>. It is an adverbial modifier of both <i>shouted</i>
and <i>burst</i>.</p>

<p id="s-518"><b>518.</b> Though a complex sentence can have but one (simple
or compound) main clause, there is, in theory, no limit to the
number of subordinate clauses.</p>

<p id="s-519"><b>519.</b> Subordinate clauses may be attached to the main clause
(1) as <b>separate modifiers or complements</b>; (2) in a <b>coördinate series
of clauses</b>, all in the same construction, and forming one <b>compound
clause</b>; (3) in a series of <b>successively subordinate clauses</b>,
forming one <b>complex clause</b>.</p>

<p id="s-520"><b>520.</b> <b>Two or more subordinate clauses may be attached to the main
clause separately, each as a distinct modifier or complement.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>The bridge, <i>which had been weakened by the ice</i>, fell with a crash <i>while
  the locomotive was crossing it</i>. [The first subordinate clause is an adjective
  modifier of <i>bridge</i>; the second is an adverbial modifier of <i>fell</i>.]</li>

  <li>The architect <i>who drew the plans</i> says <i>that the house will cost ten thousand
  dollars</i>. [The first subordinate clause is an adjective modifier of
  <i>architect</i>; the second is a complement, being the object of <i>says</i>.]</li>

  <li>Isabella, <i>whom every incident was sufficient to dismay</i>, hesitated <i>whether
  she should proceed</i>.<span class="attribution">—H. Walpole.</span></li>

  were within an unimportant distance of his ears.<span class="attribution">—Hardy.</span></li>

<b>521.</b> <b>Two or more subordinate clauses in the same construction,
forming one compound clause, may be attached to the main clause as a
modifier or complement.</b></p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. The truth was <i>that Leonard had overslept, that he had missed the
  train, and that he had failed to keep his appointment</i>.</li>

  <li>2. The guide told us <i>that the road was impassable, that the river was
  in flood, and that the bridge had been swept away</i>.</li>

</ul>

<p>In the first and second examples, three coördinate noun
clauses are joined to make one compound clause, which is used
as a complement,—as a predicate nominative in the first sentence,
as the direct object of <i>told</i> in the second.</p>

<p>In the third example, a compound adjective clause modifies
<i>Ellis</i>. In the fourth and fifth, a compound adverbial clause
modifies the predicate verb (<i>ordered</i>, <i>received</i>). In the seventh,
four <i>that</i>-clauses unite in one compound clause.</p>

<p id="s-522"><b>522.</b> <b>Two or more successively subordinate clauses, forming one
complex clause, may be joined to the main clause as a modifier or
complement.</b></p>

<p>In such a series, the first subordinate clause is attached directly
to the main clause, the second is subordinate to the first,
the third to the second, and so on in succession.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>In the course of my travels, I met a good-natured old gentleman,
(<i>a</i>) <i>who was born in the village</i> (<i>b</i>) <i>where my parents lived</i> (<i>c</i>) <i>before they
came to America</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="page-219" href="#page-219" class="pagenum" title="219"></a>
Here <i>gentleman</i> (a complement in the main clause) is modified
by the adjective clause <i>who was born in the village</i> (<i>a</i>).
<i>Village</i>, in clause <i>a</i>, is modified by the adjective clause <i>where
my parents lived</i> (<i>b</i>). <i>Lived</i>, the predicate verb of clause <i>b</i>, is
modified by the adverbial clause <i>before they came to America</i> (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p>Thus it appears that <i>a</i> is subordinate to the main clause, and
that <i>b</i>, in turn, is subordinate to <i>a</i>, and <i>c</i> to <i>b</i>. In other words,
the three clauses (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) are united to make one complex clause,—<i>who
was born in the village where my parents lived before they
came to America</i>. This clause, taken as a whole, serves as an
adjective modifier describing <i>gentleman</i>.</p>

<p id="s-523"><b>523.</b> Further examples of the <b>successive subordination</b> of one
clause to another may be seen in the following sentences:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I have passed my latter years in this city, <i>where I am frequently seen
  in public places, though there are not above half-a-dozen of my select friends
  that know me</i>.<span class="attribution">—Addison.</span></li>

  <li>In this manner they advanced by moonlight <i>till they came within view
  of the two towering rocks that form a kind of portal to the valley, at the extremity
  of which rose the vast ruins of Istakar</i>.<span class="attribution">—Beckford.</span></li>

  <li>The young fellow uttered this with an accent and a look so perfectly
  in tune to a feeling heart, <i>that I instantly made a vow I would give him a
  four-and-twenty sous piece, when I got to Marseilles</i>.<span class="attribution">—Sterne.</span> [The conjunction
  <i>that</i> is omitted before <i>I would</i> (<a href="#s-388">§&nbsp;388</a>).]</li>

  <li>Three years had scarcely elapsed <i>before the sons of Constantine seemed
  impatient to convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting themselves
  with the dominions which they were unqualified to govern</i>.<span class="attribution">—Gibbon.</span></li>

  <li>Mr. Lewis sent me an account of Dr. Arbuthnot’s illness, <i>which is a
  very sensible affliction to me, who, by living so long out of the world, have lost
  that hardness of heart contracted by years and general conversation</i>.<span class="attribution">—Swift.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The method of forming complex clauses by successive subordination,
if overworked, produces long, straggling, shapeless sentences, as in the following
example from Borrow:—“I scouted the idea that Slingsby would have
stolen this blacksmith’s gear; for I had the highest opinion of his honesty,
<i>which</i> opinion I still retain at the present day, <i>which</i> is upwards of twenty
years from the time of <i>which</i> I am speaking, during the whole of <i>which</i> period
I have neither seen the poor fellow nor received any intelligence of him.” A
famous instance of the use of this structure for comic effect is “The House
that Jack Built.”</p>

<h4>SPECIAL COMPLICATIONS</h4>

<p id="s-524"><b>524.</b> The processes of <b>coördination and subordination</b> (<a href="#s-514">§§&nbsp;514–523</a>)
may be so utilized in one and the same sentence as to
produce a very complicated structure.</p>

<p>Examples of such sentences are given below, for reference
(<a href="#s-525">§§&nbsp;525–526</a>). Their structure, however elaborate, is always
either <b>complex</b> or <b>compound complex</b>.</p>

<h5>I. IN COMPLEX SENTENCES</h5>

<p id="s-525"><b>525.</b> The following sentences are complex. They contain
either compound or complex clauses, or both.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>1. They preferred the silver with which they were familiar, and
which they were constantly passing about from hand to hand, to the
gold which they had never before seen, and with the value of which they
were unacquainted.<span class="attribution">—Macaulay.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
The main clause of this complex sentence is <i>they preferred the silver to the
gold</i>. To this are separately attached (<a href="#s-520">§&nbsp;520</a>) two adjective clauses, both <b>compound</b>:
(1) <i>with which ... hand</i>, modifying <i>silver</i>; (2) <i>which they had ... unacquainted</i>,
modifying <i>gold</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>2. All London crowded to shout and laugh round the gibbet where
hung the rotting remains of a prince who had made England the dread
of the world, who had been the chief founder of her maritime greatness
and of her colonial empire, who had conquered Scotland and Ireland,
who had humbled Holland and Spain.<span class="attribution">—Macaulay.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
The sentence is <b>complex</b>. The main clause is <i>all London crowded to shout
and laugh round the gibbet</i>. The rest of the sentence (<i>where ... Spain</i>) forms
one long complex adjective clause, modifying <i>gibbet</i>. In this complex clause,
the first clause (<i>where ... prince</i>) has dependent on it a compound adjective
clause (modifying <i>prince</i>), made up of four coördinate clauses, each beginning
with <i>who</i>. The subordination of this compound clause to that which precedes
(<i>where ... prince</i>) produces the long complex subordinate clause <i>where ...
Spain</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>3. As we cannot at present get Mr. Joseph out of the inn, we shall
leave him in it, and carry our reader on after Parson Adams, who, his
mind being perfectly at ease, fell into a contemplation on a passage in
Æschylus, which entertained him for three miles together, without suffering
him once to reflect on his fellow-traveller.<span class="attribution">—Fielding.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><a id="page-221" href="#page-221" class="pagenum" title="221"></a>
In this <b>complex sentence</b>, two subordinate clauses are separately attached
to the main clause: (1) the adverbial clause <i>as ... inn</i>; (2) the adjective
clause <i>who ... fellow-traveller</i>. This latter clause is complex, since it contains
the adjective clause <i>which ... fellow-traveller</i>, dependent on <i>who ...
Æschylus</i>, and modifying <i>passage</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>4. As I sit by my window this summer afternoon, hawks are circling
about my clearing; the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by twos and threes
athwart my view, or perching restlessly on the white pine boughs behind
my house, gives a voice to the air; a fishhawk dimples the glassy surface
of the pond and brings up a fish; a mink steals out of the marsh before
my door and seizes a frog by the shore; the sedge is bending under the
weight of the reed-birds flitting hither and hither; and for the last half
hour I have heard the rattle of railroad cars, now dying away and then
revving like the beat of a partridge, conveying travellers from Boston to
the country.<span class="attribution">—Thoreau.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This sentence is <b>complex</b>. Its main clause is compound, consisting of a series
of six coördinate simple clauses. The whole of this long compound main clause
is modified by the adverbial clause with which the sentence begins (<i>as ...
afternoon</i>).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>5. That they had sprung from obscurity, that they had acquired great
wealth, that they exhibited it insolently, that they spent it extravagantly,
that they raised the price of everything in their neighborhood, from fresh
eggs to rotten boroughs; that their liveries outshone those of dukes, that
their coaches were finer than that of the Lord Mayor, that the examples
of their large and ill-governed households corrupted half the servants in
the country; that some of them, with all their magnificence, could not
catch the tone of good society, but in spite of the stud and the crowd of
menials, of the plate and the Dresden china, of the venison and the
Burgundy, were still low men,—these were things which excited, both
in the class from which they had sprung, and in that into which they
attempted to force themselves, that bitter aversion which is the effect of
mingled envy and contempt.<span class="attribution">—Macaulay.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This <b>complex sentence</b>, though very long, is perfectly easy to follow. It
begins with a long compound noun clause (consisting of nine coördinate <i>that</i>-clauses).
This would be the subject of the main predicate verb <i>were</i>, but for
the fact that the pronoun <i>these</i> is inserted to act as the subject (referring back
to the compound noun clause and summing it up in a single word). To the
complement <i>things</i> is attached the adjective clause <i>which excited ... contempt</i>.
This clause is complex, for it contains three adjective clauses, (1) <i>from which
they had sprung</i> (modifying <i>class</i>), (2) <i>into which ... themselves</i> (modifying
<i>that</i>), and (3) <i>which is ... contempt</i> (modifying <i>aversion</i>). All three are separately
attached to the clause on which they depend, <i>which excited that bitter
aversion</i>. Thus all that portion of the sentence which follows <i>things</i> forms
one complex clause, modifying that noun.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p><a id="page-222" href="#page-222" class="pagenum" title="222"></a>
6. That I may avoid the imputation of throwing out, even privately,
any loose, random imputations against the public conduct of a gentleman
for whom I once entertained a very warm affection, and whose abilities
I regard with the greatest admiration, I will put down, distinctly and
articulately, some of the matters of objection which I feel to his late
doctrines and proceedings, trusting that I shall be able to demonstrate
to the friends whose good opinion I would still cultivate, that not levity,
nor caprice, nor less defensible motives, but that very grave reasons,
influence my judgment.<span class="attribution">—Burke.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This is a fine example of a long, but well-constructed <b>complex sentence</b>.
The main clause is <i>I will put down, distinctly and articulately, some of the
matters of objection</i>. Upon this simple clause, everything else in the sentence
depends in one way or another.</p>

<h5>II. IN COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES</h5>

<p id="s-526"><b>526.</b> Any complex sentence, however elaborate, may be
used as one of the <b>coördinate complex clauses</b> that make up a
<b>compound complex sentence</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>1. While the king was treated at this rude rate, Cromwell, with his
army, was in Scotland, obstructing the motions that were making in his
favor; but on the approach of the Scots, who were much superior in
number, he was forced to retire towards Dunbar, where his ships and
provisions lay.<span class="attribution">—Burnet.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
In this <b>compound complex sentence</b>, both coördinate clauses are complex. In
each, the main clause has two subordinate clauses attached to it separately
(<a href="#s-520">§&nbsp;520</a>).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>2. They had seen me cut the cables, and thought my design was only
to let the ships run adrift, or fall foul on each other; but when they
perceived the whole fleet moving in order, and saw me pulling at the
end, they set up such a scream of grief and despair as it is almost impossible
to describe or conceive.<span class="attribution">—Swift.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
In this <b>compound complex sentence</b>, both of the two coördinate clauses are
complex. The first contains the noun clause [<i>that</i>] <i>my design ... each other</i>,
used as the object of <i>thought</i>. The second contains two subordinate clauses,
separately attached to the main clause (<i>they set ... despair</i>). For the infinitive
<i>cut</i>, see <a href="#s-322">§&nbsp;322</a>. The infinitive <i>to let</i> is used as a predicate nominative (<a href="#s-491">§&nbsp;491</a>);
it has as its object the infinitive clause <i>the ships ... each other</i>, containing
two infinitives, <i>run</i> and <i>fall</i> (<a href="#s-325">§&nbsp;325</a>).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>3. While things went on quietly, while there was no opposition, while
everything was given by the favor of a small ruling junto, Fox had a
<a id="page-223" href="#page-223" class="pagenum" title="223"></a>
decided advantage over Pitt; but when dangerous times came, when
Europe was convulsed with war, when Parliament was broken up into
factions, when the public mind was violently excited, the favorite of the
people rose to supreme power.<span class="attribution">—Macaulay.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
This <b>compound complex sentence</b> consists of two complex clauses, joined by
the coördinate conjunction <i>but</i>. In each of these, the subordinate clause is
compound (<a href="#s-521">§&nbsp;521</a>), consisting of several coördinate adverbial clauses introduced
by relative adverbs (<i>while</i> in the first, <i>when</i> in the second).</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>4. The clear and agreeable language of his despatches had early
attracted the notice of his employers; and before the Peace of Breda
he had, at the request of Arlington, published a pamphlet on the war, of
which nothing is now known, except that it had some vogue at the time,
and that Charles, not a contemptible judge, pronounced it to be very
well written.<span class="attribution">—Macaulay.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
In this <b>compound complex sentence</b>, the first coördinate clause is simple, the
second is complex. In the second, the adjective clause <i>of which nothing is
known</i> has dependent on it the group of words <i>except ... well written</i>, consisting
of the preposition <i>except</i> and its object (the compound noun clause,
<i>that ... time, and that ... well written</i>). This group serves as an adjective
modifier of the noun <i>nothing</i>. The whole passage <i>of which ... well
written</i> forms a complex adjective clause, modifying <i>pamphlet</i>. <i>It to be very
well written</i> is a complement, being an infinitive clause used as the object of
<i>pronounced</i> (<a href="#s-325">§&nbsp;325</a>).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subtitle">ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES</span></h3>

<p id="s-527"><b>527.</b> Good usage does not demand that all sentences shall
be absolutely complete. It often allows (and sometimes requires)
the omission of words that, though necessary to the
construction, are so easily supplied by the mind that it would
be mere waste of time to utter them.</p>

<p id="s-528"><b>528.</b> <b>The omission of a word or words necessary to the grammatical
completeness of a clause or sentence is called ellipsis.</b></p>

<p><b>A clause or sentence that shows ellipsis is said to be elliptical.</b></p>

<p class="note">
<b>Ellipsis</b> is a Greek word meaning “omission.”</p>

<p>In the following examples the omitted words are supplied
in brackets.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>[I] thank you.</li>

  <li>[I] pray do not [you] move.</li>

  <li>[You] pass me that book.</li>

  <li>Her hair is light, her eyes [are] dark blue.</li>

  <li>Some of the strangers spoke French, others [spoke] Spanish.</li>

  <li>Some of the patriots were armed with old flintlocks, others [were
  armed] with swords, still others [were armed] with pitchforks.</li>

  <li>When [he was] a youth, he travelled in the East.</li>

  <li>Though [he is] timid, he is no coward.</li>

  <li>They were amused, though [they were] somewhat vexed.</li>

  <li>While [we were] drifting downstream, we grounded on a sand bar.</li>

  <li>If [it is] possible, send me word to-night.</li>

  <li>You shall have the money this week, if [it is] necessary.</li>

  <li>They marched slowly as if [they were] worn out.</li>

  <li>Why [are] these tears?</li>

  <li>Why [are you] so dejected?</li>

  <li>He was ten years of age, his brother [was] eight [years of age].</li>

  <li>I have more confidence in James than [I have] in Edmund.</li>

  <li>Mary is younger than George [is young].</li>

  <li>Tom likes you better than [he likes] me.</li>

  <li>You like him better than I do [like him].</li>

  <li><a id="page-225" href="#page-225" class="pagenum" title="225"></a>
  I like him better than Charles does [like him].</li>

  <li>This racket is not so heavy as that [is heavy].</li>

  <li>You are not so old as I [am old].</li>

  <li>Peace [be] to his memory!</li>

  <li>This is the only pencil [that] I have.</li>

  <li>Is that the boy [whom] you hired yesterday?</li>

  <li>They say [that] you are going to Europe soon.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-529"><b>529.</b> The examples in <a href="#s-528">§&nbsp;528</a> show that most cases of ellipsis
fall under two heads:</p>

<p>1. To avoid repetition, words are often omitted in one part
of the sentence when they occur in another part.</p>

<p>2. Pronouns, the conjunction <i>that</i>, and some forms of the
verb <i>is</i>, are often omitted when they are readily supplied.</p>

<p>Under the second head come (1) the ellipsis of the subject
(<i>thou</i> or <i>you</i>) in imperative sentences (<a href="#s-268">§&nbsp;268</a>), (2) that of relative
pronouns in the objective case (<a href="#s-151">§&nbsp;151</a>), (3) that of <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>,
etc. (with the subject pronoun) in subordinate clauses introduced
by <i>when</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>if</i>, and the like (<a href="#s-397">§§&nbsp;397</a>, <a href="#s-399">399</a>, <a href="#s-417">417</a>).</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The so-called “telegraphic style” omits <i>I</i> with any verb or with
all verbs. It should be confined to telegrams, where space is money.</p>

<p id="s-530"><b>530.</b> Adverbs indicating direction (like <i>forward</i>, <i>back</i>) are
often used without a verb in imperative sentences.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Forward</i>, brave companions!</li>
  <li><i>Down</i> on your knees!</li>
  <li><i>Up</i>, guards, and at them!</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In older English, the omission of the verb of motion was common,
even in sentences not imperative, as in the following examples from <i>Julius
Cæsar</i>:—“We’ll along ourselves, and meet them”; “Shall we on, and not
depend on you?”</p>

<p id="s-531"><b>531.</b> The ellipsis of the subordinate conjunction <i>that</i> is very
common, especially in indirect discourse (<a href="#s-388">§§&nbsp;388</a>, <a href="#s-433">433</a>).</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I know [<i>that</i>] you are my friend.</li>
  <li>Jack said [<i>that</i>] the boat had sunk.</li>
  <li>He told me [<i>that</i>] he was sorry.</li>
</ul>

<p id="s-532"><a id="page-226" href="#page-226" class="pagenum" title="226"></a>
<b>532.</b> Many constructions, originally elliptical, have become
established idioms in which no ellipsis is felt. In such cases
it is usually better to take the sentence as it stands, and not
to supply the omitted words.</p>

<p class="note">
Thus, in “He eats <i>as if he were famished</i>” the italicized words are
properly treated as a subordinate clause modifying <i>eats</i> and introduced
by the compound conjunction <i>as if</i>. Yet in strictness this construction is
an ellipsis for “He eats as [<i>he would eat</i>] if he were famished.”</p>

<p id="s-533"><b>533.</b> Various ellipses are illustrated in the following sentences:—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>1. Although in a friendly country, they marched always as if in a
  land of enemies.</li>

  <li>2. The aspect of the country was as wild and dreary as the climate.</li>

  <li>3. Do not serious and earnest men discuss Hamlet as they would
  Cromwell or Lincoln?<span class="attribution">—Lowell.</span></li>

  <li>4. Not so with the others.</li>

  <li>5. Though rather shy and distrustful of this new acquaintance, Rip
  complied with his usual alacrity.</li>

  <li>6. Arras was famed for its rich tapestries, Brussels for its carpets,
  Cambrai for its fine cambric, Lisle for its thread and the fabrics woven
  from it.</li>

  <li>7. Every day brings its task, which, if neglected, is doubled on the
  morrow.</li>

  <li>8. It is not easy to recover an art when once lost.</li>

  <li>9. I wish you would go down with me to Newstead.</li>

  <li>10. The men are all soldiers, and war and the chase their sole
  occupation.</li>

  <li>11. While in this state of irresolution, she was startled by a low knock.</li>

<p><i>Bear</i>, <i>break</i>, <i>drive</i>, <i>get</i> (<i>beget</i>, <i>forget</i>), <i>speak</i>, <i>spin</i>, <i>stink</i>, <i>swear</i>, <i>tear</i>, have
an archaic past tense in <i>a</i>: <i>bare</i>, <i>brake</i>, <i>drave</i>, <i>gat</i>, <i>spake</i>, etc.</p>

<p><i>Beat</i>, <i>beget</i> (<i>forget</i>), <i>bite</i>, <i>break</i>, <i>forsake</i>, <i>hide</i>, <i>ride</i>, <i>shake</i>, <i>speak</i>, <i>weave</i>,
<i>write</i>, and some other verbs have archaic forms of the past participle like
those of the past tense. The participles in <i>en</i>, however, are now the accepted
forms. <i>Chid</i> and <i>trod</i> are common participial forms.</p>

<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>drink</i>, <i>ring</i>, <i>shrink</i>, <i>sing</i>, <i>sink</i>, <i>spring</i>, <i>swim</i>, often have in poetry a
<i>u</i>-form (<i>begun</i>, <i>sung</i>, etc.) in the past tense as well as in the past participle.
This form (though good <i>old</i> English)<a href="#footnote-64" id="marker-64" class="marker" title="Footnote 64"><sup>64</sup></a> should be avoided in modern speech.</p>

<p><i>Bend</i>, <i>beseech</i>, <i>bet</i>, <i>build</i>, <i>burst</i>, <i>catch</i>, <i>dwell</i>, <i>rend</i>, <i>split</i>, <i>wet</i>, have archaic
or less usual forms in <i>ed</i>: <i>bended</i>, <i>beseeched</i>, <i>betted</i>, etc. <i>Builded</i> is common
in the proverbial “He <i>builded</i> better than he knew.” <i>Bursted</i> is common
as an adjective: “a <i>bursted</i> bubble.”</p>

<p><i>Bid</i>, “to command,” has sometimes <i>bid</i> in both the past tense and the
past participle; <i>bid</i>, “to offer money,” has these forms regularly.</p>

<p><i>Blend</i>, <i>leap</i>, <i>lean</i>, have usually <i>blended</i>, <i>leaped</i>, <i>leaned</i>; but <i>blent</i>, <i>leapt</i>,
<i>leant</i> are not uncommon.</p>

<p><i>Clothe</i> has commonly <i>clothed</i>; but <i>clad</i> is common in literary use, and
is regular in the adjectives <i>well-clad</i>, <i>ill-clad</i> (for which ordinary speech
has substituted <i>well-dressed</i>, <i>badly</i> or <i>poorly dressed</i>).
<a id="page-298" href="#page-298" class="pagenum" title="298"></a></p>

<p><i>Dive</i> has <i>dived</i>; but <i>dove</i> (an old form) is common in America.</p>

<p><i>Plead</i> has past tense and past participle <i>pleaded</i>. <i>Plead</i> (pronounced <i>plĕd</i>)
is avoided by careful writers and speakers.</p>

<p><i>Prove</i> has past tense and past participle <i>proved</i>. The past participle <i>proven</i>
should be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Work</i> has past tense and past participle <i>worked</i>. <i>Wrought</i> in the past tense
and the past participle is archaic, but is also modern as an adjective (as in
<i>wrought iron</i>).</p>

<p>Some verbs have rare or archaic weak forms alongside of the strong forms;
thus <i>digged,</i> <i>shined</i>, past tense and past participle of <i>dig</i>, <i>shine</i>; <i>showed</i>, past
participle of <i>show</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ate</i> and <i>eaten</i> are preferred to <i>eat</i> (pronounced <i>ĕt</i>).</p>

<p><i>Quoth</i>, “said,” is an old strong past tense. The compound <i>bequeath</i> has
<i>bequeathed</i> only.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous archaisms are the past tenses <i>sate</i> for <i>sat</i>, <i>trode</i> for <i>trod</i>, <i>spat</i>
for <i>spit</i>; also <i>writ</i> for <i>wrote</i> and <i>written</i>, <i>rid</i> for <i>rode</i> and <i>ridden</i>, <i>strewed</i> and
<i>strown</i> for <i>strewn</i>.</p>
</div>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>The following verbs vary between <i>ed</i> and <i>t</i> (<i>d</i>) in the past
tense and the past participle. In some of them, this variation
is a mere difference of spelling. In writing, the <i>ed</i> forms are preferred
in most cases; in speaking, the <i>t</i> forms are very common.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<div class="note">
<p>The present tense of <i>may</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>shall</i>, is an old strong past. Hence
the first and third persons singular are alike:—<i>I may</i>, <i>he may</i>. The
actual past tenses of these verbs are weak forms:—<i>might</i>, <i>could</i>,
<i>should</i>. <i>Must</i> is the weak past tense of an obsolete <i>mōt</i>, and is almost
always used as a present tense (<a href="#s-292">§&nbsp;292</a>).</p>

<p><i>Dare</i> and <i>owe</i> originally belonged to this class. <i>Owe</i> has become
a regular weak verb, except for the peculiar past tense <i>ought</i>, which
is used in a present sense (see <a href="#s-293">§&nbsp;293</a>); <i>dare</i> has in the third person
<i>dare</i> or <i>dares</i>, and in the past <i>dared</i>, more rarely <i>durst</i>. The archaic
<i>wot</i> “know,” past <i>wist</i>, also belongs to this class. <i>Will</i> is inflected
like <i>shall</i>, having <i>will</i> in the first and third singular, <i>wilt</i> in the second
singular, and <i>would</i> in the past.</p>

<h3>USE OF CAPITAL LETTERS</h3>

<p>1. Every sentence begins with a capital letter.</p>

<p>2. Every line of poetry begins with a capital letter.</p>

<p>3. The first word of every direct quotation begins with a capital
letter.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This rule does not apply to quoted fragments of sentences.</p>

<p>4. Every proper noun or abbreviation of a proper noun begins
with a capital letter.</p>

<p>5. Most adjectives derived from proper nouns begin with capital
letters; as,—<i>American</i>, <i>Indian</i>, <i>Swedish</i>, <i>Spenserian</i>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Some adjectives derived from proper nouns have ceased to be
closely associated in thought with the nouns from which they come, and
therefore begin with small letters. Thus,—voltaic, galvanic, mesmeric,
maudlin, stentorian.</p>

<p>6. Every title attached to the name of a person begins with a
capital letter.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li><i>Mr.</i> Thomas Smith</li>
  <li>John Wilson, <i>Esq.</i></li>
  <li><i>Miss</i> Allerton</li>
  <li><i>Dr.</i> F.&nbsp;E. Wilson</li>
  <li>C.&nbsp;J. Adams, <i>M.D.</i></li>
  <li><i>President</i> Grant</li>
  <li><i>Professor</i> Whitney</li>
  <li><i>Sir</i> Walter Raleigh</li>
</ul>

<p>7. In titles of books, etc., the first word, as well as every important
word that follows, begins with a capital letter.</p>

<p>8. The interjection <i>O</i> and the pronoun <i>I</i> are always written in
capital letters.</p>

<p>9. Personal pronouns referring to the Deity are often capitalized.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Usage varies: the personal pronouns are commonly capitalized
when they refer to the Deity, the relatives less frequently. The rule is often
disregarded altogether when its observance would result in a multitude of
capitals, as in the Bible and in many hymn books and works of theology.</p>

<p>10. Common nouns and adjectives often begin with capital letters
when they designate the topics or main points of definitions or similar
statements. Such capitals are called <i>emphatic</i> (or <i>topical</i>) <i>capitals</i>.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Emphatic (or topical) capitals are analogous to capitals in the
titles of books (see Rule 7), but their use is not obligatory. They are especially
common in text-books and other elementary manuals.</p>

<h3>RULES OF PUNCTUATION<a href="#footnote-68" id="marker-68" class="marker" title="Footnote 68"><sup>68</sup></a></h3>

<p>The common marks of punctuation are the period, the interrogation
point, the exclamation point, the comma, the semicolon,
the colon, the dash, marks of parenthesis, and quotation marks.
The hyphen and the apostrophe may be conveniently treated
along with marks of punctuation.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>1. The period, the interrogation point, and the exclamation point
are used at the end of sentences. Every complete sentence must be
followed by one of these three marks.</p>

<p>The end of a declarative or an imperative sentence is marked by
a period. But a declarative or an imperative sentence that is likewise
exclamatory may be followed by an exclamation point instead
of a period.</p>

<p>The end of a direct question is marked by an interrogation point.</p>

<p>An exclamatory sentence in the form of an indirect question is followed
by an exclamation point; as,—“How absolute the knave is!”</p>

<p>2. A period is used after an abbreviation.</p>

<p>3. An exclamation point is used after an exclamatory word or
phrase.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This rule is not absolute. Most interjections take the exclamation
point. With other words and with phrases, usage differs; if strong feeling is
expressed, the exclamation point is commonly used, but too many such marks
deface the page.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>The comma is used—</p>

<p>1. After a noun (or a phrase) of direct address (a <i>vocative nominative</i>).
Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>John, tell me the truth.</li>
  <li>Little boy, what is your name?</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> If the noun is exclamatory, an exclamation point may be used
instead of a comma.</p>

<p><a id="page-307" href="#page-307" class="pagenum" title="307"></a>
2. Before a direct quotation in a sentence. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The cry ran through the ranks, “Are we never to move forward?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> When the quotation is long or formal, a colon, or a colon and a
dash, may be used instead of a comma, especially with the words <i>as follows</i>.</p>

<p>3. After a direct quotation when this is the subject or the object
of a following verb. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>“They are coming; the attack will be made on the center,” said Lord
Fitzroy Somerset.</p>

<p>“I see it,” was the cool reply of the duke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> If the quotation ends with an interrogation point or an exclamation
point, no comma is used.</p>

<p>4. To separate words, or groups of words, arranged in a coördinate
series, when these are not connected by <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, or <i>nor</i>.</p>

<p>If the conjunction is used to connect the last two members of the
series but omitted with the others, the comma may be used before
the conjunction.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer.</li>

  <li>They were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was difficult to come
  at them.</li>

  <li>It would make the reader pity me to tell what odd, misshapen, ugly things
  I made.</li>

  <li>They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note 1.</span> Commas may be used even when conjunctions are expressed, if
the members of the series consist of several words, or if the writer wishes to
emphasize their distinctness.</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note 2.</span> Clauses in a series are commonly separated by semicolons unless
they are short and simple (see <a href="#page-309">pp.&nbsp;309–310</a>).</p>

<p>5. To set off words and phrases out of their regular order. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Seated on her accustomed chair, with her usual air of apathy and want of
interest in what surrounded her, she seemed now and then mechanically to
resume the motion of twirling her spindle.<span class="attribution">—Scott.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>6. To separate a long subject from the verb of the predicate.
Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>To have passed them over in an historical sketch of my literary life and
opinions, would have seemed to me like the denial of a debt.<span class="attribution">—Coleridge.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>7. To set off an appositive noun or an appositive adjective, with
its modifiers. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>I have had the most amusing letter from Hogg, the Ettrick minstrel.</p>

<p><a id="page-308" href="#page-308" class="pagenum" title="308"></a>
There was an impression upon the public mind, natural enough from the
continually augmenting velocity of the mail, but quite erroneous, that an outside
seat on this class of carriages was a post of danger.<span class="attribution">—De Quincey.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note 1.</span> Many participial and other adjective phrases come under this
head. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The genius, seeing me indulge myself on this melancholy prospect, told me
I had dwelt long enough upon it.<span class="attribution">—Addison.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note 2.</span> If a noun and its appositive are so closely connected as to form
one idea, no comma is used. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>My friend Jackson lives in San Francisco.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note 3.</span> An intensive pronoun (<i>myself</i>, etc.) is not separated by a comma
from the substantive which it emphasizes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 4.</span> A series of words or phrases in apposition with a single substantive
is sometimes set off, as a whole, by a comma and a dash.</p>
</div>

<p>8. To set off a subordinate clause, especially one introduced by
a descriptive relative. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>I am going to take a last dinner with a most agreeable family, who have
been my only neighbors ever since I have lived at Weston.<span class="attribution">—Cowper.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> No comma is used before a restrictive relative. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>I want to know many things which only you can tell me.</li>
  <li>Perhaps I am the only man in England who can boast of such good fortune.</li>
</ul>

<p>9. To set off a phrase containing a nominative absolute. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>They had some difficulty in passing the ferry at the riverside, the ferryman
being afraid of them.<span class="attribution">—Defoe.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>10. To set off <i>however</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>, <i>moreover</i>, etc., and introductory
phrases like <i>in the first place</i>, <i>on the one hand</i>, etc.</p>

<p>11. To set off a parenthetical expression. For this purpose commas,
dashes, or marks of parenthesis may be used.</p>

<p>When the parenthetical matter is brief or closely related to the
rest of the sentence, it is generally set off by commas. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>I exercised a piece of hypocrisy for which, I hope, you will hold me
excused.<span class="attribution">—Thackeray.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it is longer and more independent, it is generally marked
off by dashes, or enclosed in marks of parenthesis. The latter are
less frequently used at present than formerly.</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The connection of the mail with the state and the executive government—a
connection obvious, but yet not strictly defined—gave to the whole mail
establishment an official grandeur.<span class="attribution">—De Quincey.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span> Brackets are used to indicate insertions that are not part of the text.</p>
<a id="page-309" href="#page-309" class="pagenum" title="309"></a>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>The clauses of a compound sentence may be separated by colons,
semicolons, or commas.</p>

<p>1. The colon is used—</p>

<p class="hang">
<i>a.</i> To show that the second of two clauses repeats the substance
of the first in another form, or defines the first as an
appositive defines a noun. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>This was the practice of the Grecian stage. But Terence made an innovation
in the Roman: all his plays have double actions.<span class="attribution">—Dryden.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="hang">
<i>b.</i> To separate two groups of clauses one or both of which contain
a semicolon. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>At that time, news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating
so far into the recesses of the mountains; but now, as you know, the
approach is easy, and the communication, in summer time, almost hourly:
nor is this strange, for travellers after pleasure are become not less active,
and more numerous, than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of
gain.<span class="attribution">—Wordsworth.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The colon is less used now than formerly. The tendency is to use
a semicolon or to begin a new sentence.</p>

<p>2. The semicolon is used when the clauses are of the same general
nature and contribute to the same general effect, especially if one or
more of them contain commas. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>The sky was cloudless; the sun shone out bright and warm; the songs of
birds, and hum of myriads of summer insects filled the air; and the cottage
garden, crowded with every rich and beautiful tint, sparkled in the heavy dew
like beds of glittering jewels.<span class="attribution">—Dickens.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>3. The comma may be used when the clauses are short and simple
(see <a href="#page-307">p.&nbsp;307</a>).</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The choice between colon, semicolon, and comma is determined in
many cases by the writer’s feeling of the closer or the looser connection of the
ideas expressed by the several clauses, and is to some extent a matter of taste.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>1. In a complex sentence, the dependent clause is generally separated
from the main clause by a comma. But when the dependent
clause is short and the connection close, the comma may be omitted.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> A descriptive relative clause is preceded by a comma, a restrictive
relative clause is not (see <a href="#page-70">p.&nbsp;70</a>).</p>

<p><a id="page-310" href="#page-310" class="pagenum" title="310"></a>
2. The clauses of a series, when in the same dependent construction,
are often separated by semicolons to give more emphasis to each.
Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>[Mrs. Battle] was none of your lukewarm gamesters, your half-and-half
players, who have no objection to take a hand if you want one to make up a
rubber; who affirm that they have no pleasure in winning; that they like to
win one game and lose another; that they can while away an hour very agreeably
at a card table, but are indifferent whether they play or no; and will
desire an adversary who has slipped a wrong card, to take it up and play
another.<span class="smcap">—Lamb.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>1. A direct quotation is enclosed in quotation marks.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> If the quotation stands by itself and is printed in different type,
the marks may be omitted.</p>

<p>2. A quotation within a quotation is usually enclosed in single
quotation marks.</p>

<p>3. In a quotation consisting of several paragraphs, quotation marks
are put at the beginning of each paragraph and at the end of the last.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> For the punctuation before a quotation, see <a href="#page-307">p.&nbsp;307</a>.</p>

<p>4. When a book, poem, or the like, is referred to, the title may be
enclosed in quotation marks or italicized.</p>

<h4>VI</h4>

<p>1. Sudden changes in thought and feeling or breaks in speech are
indicated by dashes. Thus,—</p>

<blockquote class="example">
<p>Eh!—what—why—upon my life, and so it is—Charley, my boy, so it’s
you, is it?<span class="attribution">—Lever.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. Parenthetical expressions may be set off by dashes (see <a href="#page-308">p.&nbsp;308</a>).</p>

<p>3. A colon, or colon and dash, may precede an enumeration, a direct
quotation, or a statement formally introduced,—especially with <i>as
follows</i>, <i>namely</i>, and the like. Before an enumeration a comma and a
dash may be used. Thus,—</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>There are eight parts of speech:—nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs,
  prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. <span class="smcap">Or</span>—</li>
  <li>There are eight parts of speech,—nouns, pronouns, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. The dash is sometimes used to strengthen a comma (as in the
last paragraph but one).
<a id="page-311" href="#page-311" class="pagenum" title="311"></a></p>

<h4>VII</h4>

<p>1. The apostrophe is used—</p>

<ul class="hang">
  <li><i>a.</i> To mark the omission of a letter or letters in contractions.</li>
  <li><i>b.</i> As a sign of the possessive or genitive.</li>
  <li><i>c.</i> To indicate the plural of letters, signs, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. The hyphen is used—</p>

<ul class="hang">
  <li><i>a.</i> When the parts of a word are separated in writing.</li>
  <li><i>b.</i> Between the parts of some compound words. (See the
  dictionary in each case.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>RULES OF SYNTAX</h3>

<p>1. The <b>subject</b> of a verb is in the <b>nominative case</b> (<a href="#page-41">p.&nbsp;41</a>).</p>

<p>2. A substantive standing in the predicate, but describing or
defining the subject, agrees with the subject in case and is called
a <b>predicate nominative</b> (<a href="#page-41">p.&nbsp;41</a>).</p>

<p>3. A substantive used for the purpose of <b>addressing</b> a person
directly, and not connected with any verb, is called a <b>vocative</b>.</p>

<p>A vocative is in the <b>nominative case</b>, and is often called a <b>nominative
by direct address</b> or a <b>vocative nominative</b> (<a href="#page-42">p.&nbsp;42</a>).</p>

<p>4. A substantive used as an <b>exclamation</b> is called an <b>exclamatory
nominative</b> or a <b>nominative of exclamation</b> (<a href="#page-42">p.&nbsp;42</a>).</p>

<p>5. A substantive, with a participle, may express the cause, time,
or circumstances of an action.</p>

<p>This is called the <b>absolute construction</b>.</p>

<p>The substantive is in the <b>nominative case</b> and is called a <b>nominative
absolute</b> (<a href="#page-144">p.&nbsp;144</a>).</p>

<p>6. The <b>possessive case</b> denotes ownership or possession (<a href="#page-43">p.&nbsp;43</a>).</p>

<p>7. The <b>object</b> of a verb or preposition is in the <b>objective case</b> (<a href="#page-47">p.&nbsp;47</a>).</p>

<p>8. A substantive that completes the meaning of a transitive verb
is called its <b>direct object</b>, and is said to be in the <b>objective case</b> (<a href="#page-48">p.&nbsp;48</a>).</p>

<p>9. A verb of <i>asking</i> sometimes takes <b>two direct objects</b>, one denoting
the <b>person</b> and the other the <b>thing</b> (<a href="#page-50">p.&nbsp;50</a>).</p>

<p>10. Verbs of <i>choosing</i>, <i>calling</i>, <i>naming</i>, <i>making</i>, and <i>thinking</i> may
take <b>two objects</b> referring to the same person or thing.
<a id="page-312" href="#page-312" class="pagenum" title="312"></a></p>

<p>The first of these is the <b>direct object</b>, and the second, which completes
the sense of the predicate, is called a <b>predicate objective</b>
(pp.&nbsp;50, 111).</p>

<p>11. Some verbs of <i>giving</i>, <i>telling</i>, <i>refusing</i>, and the like, may take
<b>two objects</b>, a <b>direct object</b> and an <b>indirect object</b>.</p>

<p>The indirect object denotes the person or thing toward whom or
toward which is directed the action expressed by the rest of the
predicate (<a href="#page-50">p.&nbsp;50</a>).</p>

<p>12. A verb that is regularly intransitive sometimes takes as object
a noun whose meaning closely resembles its own.</p>

<p>A noun in this construction is called the <b>cognate object</b> of the verb
and is in the <b>objective case</b> (<a href="#page-52">p.&nbsp;52</a>).</p>

<p>13. A noun, or a group of words consisting of a noun and its modifiers,
may be used adverbially. Such a noun is called an <b>adverbial
objective</b> (<a href="#page-53">p.&nbsp;53</a>).</p>

<p>14. An <b>appositive</b> is in the same case as the substantive which it
limits (<a href="#page-42">p.&nbsp;42</a>).</p>

<p>15. A pronoun must agree with its antecedent in <b>gender</b>, <b>number</b>,
and <b>person</b> (<a href="#page-55">p.&nbsp;55</a>).</p>

<p>16. <b>Relative pronouns</b> connect dependent clauses with main clauses
by referring directly to a substantive in the main clause.</p>

<p>This substantive is the <b>antecedent</b> of the relative (<a href="#page-66">p.&nbsp;66</a>).</p>

<p>A relative pronoun must agree with its antecedent in <b>gender</b>, <b>number</b>,
and <b>person</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>case</b> of a relative pronoun has nothing to do with its antecedent,
but depends on the construction of its own clause (<a href="#page-68">p.&nbsp;68</a>).</p>

<p>17. A relative pronoun in the objective case is often omitted (<a href="#page-69">p.&nbsp;69</a>).</p>

<p>18. The relative pronoun <i>what</i> is equivalent to <i>that which</i>, and has
a <b>double construction</b>:—(1) the construction of the <b>omitted</b> or <b>implied
antecedent</b> <i>that</i>; (2) the construction of the <b>relative</b> <i>which</i> (<a href="#page-71">p.&nbsp;71</a>).</p>

<p>19. The <b>compound relative pronouns</b> may include or imply their
own antecedents and hence may have a <b>double construction</b> (<a href="#page-72">p.&nbsp;72</a>).</p>

<p>The compound relatives are sometimes used without an antecedent
expressed or implied (<a href="#page-72">p.&nbsp;72</a>).</p>

<p>20. An adjective is said to <b>belong</b> to the substantive which it describes
or limits (pp.&nbsp;5, 75).</p>

<p>21. Adjectives may be classified, according to their position in the
sentence, as <b>attributive</b>, <b>appositive</b>, and <b>predicate adjectives</b> (<a href="#page-76">p.&nbsp;76</a>).
<a id="page-313" href="#page-313" class="pagenum" title="313"></a></p>

<p>1. An <b>attributive adjective</b> is closely attached to its noun and
regularly precedes it.</p>

<p>2. An <b>appositive adjective</b> is added to its noun to explain it, like
a noun in apposition.</p>

<p>3. A <b>predicate adjective</b> completes the meaning of the predicate
verb, but describes or limits the subject.</p>

<p>For the use of an adjective as <b>predicate objective</b>, see <a href="#s-488">§&nbsp;488</a>.</p>

<p>22. The <b>comparative degree</b>, not the superlative, is used in comparing
two persons or things.</p>

<p>The <b>superlative</b> is used in comparing one person or thing with two
or more (<a href="#page-88">p.&nbsp;88</a>).</p>

<p>23. <b>Relative adverbs</b> introduce subordinate clauses and are similar
in their use to relative pronouns (<a href="#page-86">p.&nbsp;86</a>).</p>

<p>24. A <b>verb</b> must agree with its subject in <b>number</b> and <b>person</b> (<a href="#page-97">p.&nbsp;97</a>).</p>

<p>25. A <b>compound subject</b> with <i>and</i> usually takes a verb in the plural
number (<a href="#page-100">p.&nbsp;100</a>).</p>

<p>26. A <b>compound subject</b> with <i>or</i> or <i>nor</i> takes a verb in the singular
number if the substantives are singular (<a href="#page-100">p.&nbsp;100</a>).</p>

<p>27. Nouns that are <b>plural in form but singular in sense</b> commonly
take a verb in the singular number (<a href="#page-101">p.&nbsp;101</a>).</p>

<p>28. <b>Collective nouns</b> take sometimes a singular and sometimes a
plural verb.</p>

<p>When the persons or things denoted are thought of as <b>individuals</b>,
the plural should be used. When the collection is regarded as a <b>unit</b>,
the singular should be used (<a href="#page-101">p.&nbsp;101</a>).</p>

<p>29. A verb is in the <b>active voice</b> when it represents the subject as
the <b>doer</b> of an act (<a href="#page-107">p.&nbsp;107</a>).</p>

<p>30. A verb is in the <b>passive voice</b> when it represents the subject as
the <b>receiver</b> or the <b>product</b> of an action (<a href="#page-107">p.&nbsp;107</a>).</p>

<p>The object of the active verb becomes the subject of the passive,
and the subject of the active verb becomes in the passive an adverbial
phrase modifying the predicate verb (<a href="#page-110">p.&nbsp;110</a>).</p>

<p>31. When a verb takes both a <b>direct</b> and an <b>indirect object</b>, one of
the two is often retained after the passive, the other becoming the
subject (<a href="#page-112">p.&nbsp;112</a>).</p>

<p>32. The <b>indicative</b> is the mood of <b>simple assertion</b> or <b>interrogation</b>,
but it is used in other constructions also (<a href="#page-115">p.&nbsp;115</a>).</p>

<p>33. The <b>imperative</b> is the mood of <b>command</b> or <b>request</b> (<a href="#page-115">p.&nbsp;115</a>).
<a id="page-314" href="#page-314" class="pagenum" title="314"></a></p>

<p>34. The <b>subject</b> of an <b>imperative</b> is seldom expressed unless it is
emphatic.</p>

<p>The subject, when expressed, may precede the imperative: as,—<i>You
go</i>, <i>You read</i> (<a href="#page-117">p.&nbsp;117</a>).</p>

<p>35. The <b>subjunctive mood</b> is used in certain special constructions
of <b>wish</b>, <b>condition</b>, and the like (pp.&nbsp;115, 118).</p>

<p>For particulars and examples, see <a href="#page-119">pp.&nbsp;119–123</a>.</p>

<p>For modal auxiliaries, see <a href="#page-124">pp.&nbsp;124–132</a>.</p>

<p>36. An <b>infinitive</b>, with or without a complement or modifiers, may
be used as the <b>subject</b> of a sentence, as a <b>predicate nominative</b>, or as
an <b>appositive</b> (pp.&nbsp;134, 135).</p>

<p>37. An <b>infinitive</b> may be used as the <b>object</b> of the prepositions <i>but</i>,
<i>except</i>, <i>about</i>, (<a href="#page-135">p.&nbsp;135</a>).</p>

<p>38. The <b>infinitive</b> may be used as a <b>nominative of exclamation</b>
(<a href="#page-136">p.&nbsp;136</a>).</p>

<p>39. An <b>infinitive</b> may modify a verb by <b>completing</b> its meaning, or
by expressing the <b>purpose</b> of the action (<a href="#page-137">p.&nbsp;137</a>).</p>

<p>40. An <b>infinitive</b> may be used as an <b>adjective modifier</b> of a <b>noun</b> or
as an <b>adverbial modifier</b> of an <b>adjective</b>.</p>

<p>In this use the infinitive is said to <b>depend</b> on the word which it
modifies (<a href="#page-136">p.&nbsp;136</a>).</p>

<p>41. A kind of <b>clause</b>, consisting of a substantive in the objective
case followed by an <b>infinitive</b>, may be used as the object of certain
verbs.</p>

<p>Such clauses are called <b>infinitive clauses</b>, and the substantive is
said to be the subject of the infinitive.</p>

<p>The <b>subject</b> of an <b>infinitive</b> is in the objective case.</p>

<p><b>Infinitive clauses</b> are used (1) after verbs of <i>wishing</i>, <i>commanding</i>,
<i>advising</i>, and the like, and (2) after some verbs of <i>believing</i>, <i>declaring</i>,
and <i>perceiving</i> (<a href="#page-138">p.&nbsp;138</a>).</p>

<p>An infinitive clause may be the object of the preposition <i>for</i>.</p>

<p>An infinitive clause with <i>for</i> may be used as a subject, as a predicate
nominative, or as the object of a preposition (<a href="#page-138">pp.&nbsp;138–139</a>).</p>

<p>42. The participle is a verb-form which has no subject, but which
partakes of the nature of an adjective and expresses action or state
in such a way as to describe or limit a substantive (pp.&nbsp;12, 140).</p>

<p>43. A <b>participle</b> is said to <b>belong</b> to the substantive which it describes
or limits (pp.&nbsp;12, 142).
<a id="page-315" href="#page-315" class="pagenum" title="315"></a></p>

<p>44. A participle should not be used without some substantive to
which it may belong (<a href="#page-142">p.&nbsp;142</a>).</p>

<p>45. An <b>infinitive</b> or a <b>participle</b>, like any other verb-form, may
take an <b>object</b> if its meaning allows (pp.&nbsp;134, 143).</p>

<p>46. <b>Infinitives</b> and <b>participles</b>, like other verb-forms, may be <b>modified</b>
by adverbs, adverbial phrases, or adverbial clauses (pp.&nbsp;134, 142).</p>

<p>47. <b>Verbal</b> (or <b>participial</b>) <b>nouns</b> in <i>-ing</i> have the form of present
participles, but the construction of nouns (<a href="#page-145">p.&nbsp;145</a>).</p>

<p>48. <b>Verbal nouns</b> in <i>-ing</i> have certain properties of the verb (<a href="#page-146">p.&nbsp;146</a>).</p>

<h3>THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</h3>

<p>English is a member of the great Indo-European Family of
languages, which is so called because it includes well-nigh all the
languages of Europe and the most important of those found in India.
Within this family, English belongs to the Teutonic (or Germanic)
Group, which contains also German, Dutch, the Scandinavian tongues
(Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish), and some others.</p>

<p>English of the oldest period is called either Anglo-Saxon or Old
English. This was the speech of certain piratical tribes whose home
was in northern Germany, on the eastern and southern shores of the
North Sea, but who invaded Britain about <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 450, and subdued
the Celtic inhabitants of the island in a series of fierce wars. The
most considerable of the invading tribes were the Angles and the
Saxons. Their dominion was well assured by the beginning of
the seventh century, and their language, which they usually called
“English” (that is, “the tongue of the Angles”), gradually spread
through England and most of Scotland. In Wales, however, the
native Britons have maintained their own Celtic speech to the
present day; and in the Scottish Highlands, Gaelic—which is akin
to Welsh and practically identical with the native language of
Ireland—is still extensively used.</p>

<p>At the time of the invasion, the Angles and Saxons were heathen,
and the Britons, who had been for four centuries under the sway of
the Roman Empire, were Christians, and much more highly civilized
than their conquerors. Indeed, they had adopted many features of
Roman culture, and Latin was spoken to some extent, at least in
the larger towns. By the end of the seventh century, however, the
Anglo-Saxons also had embraced Christianity and had made remarkable
advances in literature and learning. The language of the
Britons exerted but slight influence upon that of the Anglo-Saxons.
The Celtic words in English are few in number, and most of them
were borrowed in comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>The Norman Conquest (1066) marks a highly significant date in
the history of our language. The Normans were a Scandinavian
tribe who had been in possession of Normandy (in northern France)
for about a hundred and fifty years. They had abandoned their
<a id="page-317" href="#page-317" class="pagenum" title="317"></a>
native tongue, and spoke a dialect of French. From 1066 to about
the year 1400, two languages were therefore common in England,—English,
which was employed by the vast majority of the people,
and French, which was the language of the court and the higher
orders. French, however, was never a serious rival of English for
supremacy in the island. It was the speech of a class, not of the
nation, and its use gradually died out, except as an accomplishment.
By the time of Chaucer (who was born about 1340 and died in 1400),
it was clear that the English tongue was henceforth to be regarded
as the only natural language for Englishmen, whether they were of
Anglo-Saxon or of Norman origin.</p>

<p>Still, the Norman conquest had a profound influence upon English.
It is not true—though often asserted—that the multitude of
French words which our language contains were derived from the
Norman dialect. Comparatively few of them came into English until
after 1300, when Normandy had been lost to the English crown for
a hundred years. Since 1300 we have borrowed freely—not from
Norman, however, but from Central (or Parisian) French, which had
become the standard to which the English descendants of the Normans
endeavored to conform. The effect of the Conquest, then, was
not to fill English with Norman terms. It was rather to bring England
into close social and literary relations with France, and thus
to facilitate the adoption of words and constructions from Central
French.</p>

<p>Further, since literature was in the middle ages dependent in the
main upon private patronage, the existence of a ruling class whose
interest was in French, discouraged the maintenance of any national
or general standard of English composition. Every English writer
had recourse to his local dialect, and one dialect was felt to be as
good as another.</p>

<p>By 1350, however, the dialect of London and the vicinity had come,
apparently, to be regarded as somewhat more elegant and polished
than the others. All that was needed was the appearance of some
writer of supreme genius to whom this dialect should be native.
Chaucer was such a writer, for he was born in London. To be
sure, Chaucer did not “make modern English.” None the less,
he was a powerful agent in settling the language. Since his time,
at all events, the fact of a “standard of literary usage” has been
<a id="page-318" href="#page-318" class="pagenum" title="318"></a>
undisputed. Dialects still exist, but they are not regarded as authoritative.
Educated speakers and writers of English, the world over,
use the language with substantial uniformity.<a href="#footnote-69" id="marker-69" class="marker" title="Footnote 69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>Meantime, however, the English of the Anglo-Saxons had undergone
many changes before Chaucer was born. Most of its inflections
had been lost, and still others have been discarded since. Further,
there had been extensive borrowing from French and Latin, and this
continued throughout the fourteenth century. The habit, once
formed, has proved lasting. Our vocabulary has received contributions
from many languages, and is still receiving them. Greek may be
mentioned in particular as the source of many words, especially in
the various departments of science. But French and Latin remain
the chief foreign elements in English.</p>

<p>In the following extract from Scott, most of the words printed in
Roman type are of Anglo-Saxon origin, whereas the italicized words
are derived from Latin or French.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="example">It was not until evening was nearly <i>closed</i> that Ivanhoe was <i>restored</i>
to <i>consciousness</i> of his <i>situation</i>. He awoke from a broken slumber, under
the <i>confused impressions</i> which are <i>naturally attendant</i> on the <i>recovery</i>
from a <i>state</i> of <i>insensibility</i>. He was un<i>able</i> for some time to recall <i>exactly</i>
to <i>memory</i> the <i>circumstances</i> which had <i>preceded</i> his fall in the <i>lists</i>, or to
make out any <i>connected chain</i> of the <i>events</i> in which he had been <i>engaged</i>
upon the yesterday. A <i>sense</i> of wounds and <i>injury</i>, <i>joined</i> to great weakness
and <i>exhaustion</i>, was mingled with the <i>recollection</i> of blows dealt and
<i>received</i>, of steeds rushing upon each other, overthrowing and overthrown,
of shouts and clashing of <i>arms</i>, and all the heady <i>tumult</i> of a <i>confused</i>
fight. An <i>effort</i> to draw aside the <i>curtain</i> of his <i>couch</i> was in some <i>degree
success</i>ful, although <i>rendered difficult</i> by the <i>pain</i> of his wound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>English has also adopted a good many Scandinavian words, though
they form no such proportion of its vocabulary as French or Latin.
Danish and Norwegian pirates began to harry the coast in the eighth
century. Permanent settlements followed, as well as wars of conquest,
and for about thirty years (1013–1042) a Danish family occupied
the English throne. These events explain the Scandinavian
element in our language.</p>

<p><a id="page-319" href="#page-319" class="pagenum" title="319"></a>
Despite the freedom with which English has adopted words from
abroad, it is still essentially a Germanic speech. Its structure is still
the native structure. The borrowings have enriched its vocabulary,
but have had comparatively little effect upon its syntax. The foreign
words have been naturalized, and their presence in no wise interferes
with the unity and general consistency of the English language.
It is a strange error to regard English as a combination of Anglo-Saxon
and Norman French. As for the loss or decay of inflections,
that is not due to a mixture of dialects. It is a natural tendency,
which may be seen, for example, in Dutch and Danish, though there
was no Norman Conquest in Holland or Denmark. The loss, indeed,
is really a gain, for it is progress in the direction of simplicity.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon or Old English Period comes down to about a
century, or a century and a half, after the Norman Conquest. Its
extreme limit may be set at 1200. The period from 1200 to 1500
is usually known as the Middle English Period. From 1500 to the
present time may be regarded as the Modern Period, though within
these boundaries English has changed enormously in pronunciation
and in vocabulary, very largely in syntax, and to some extent in inflection.
The almost complete abandonment of the subjunctive in
common speech is one of the latest of these changes. This, too, is
in the direction of simplicity.</p>

<p>The people of Great Britain have long been famous as travellers,
explorers, and colonizers. Their language, once the dialect (or dialects)
of a handful of Germanic adventurers, has spread to all parts
of the world, so that now it is not merely the language of England,
but, to a considerable extent, that of Scotland, Ireland, North America,
India, Australasia, and South Africa. In this vast area, numerous varieties
of pronunciation and of idiom of course occur, but, on the
whole, the uniformity of the language is surprisingly well preserved.</p>
